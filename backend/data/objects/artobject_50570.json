            "textentryhtml":"\r\nWhite was an acclaimed Pictorialist photographer and influential teacher who opened a school for photography in 1914. White’s own work tended toward quiet interior and garden scenes that often involved his wife and other family members. This photograph is a cyanotype, which takes its name from Greek and means \"dark blue impression.\" Invented in the 1840s, the technique was not widely used until the 1880s when amateurs discovered it to be a quick, cheap means of producing sample prints from negatives. To create a cyanotype, a piece of paper or cloth is coated with a light-sensitive solution of ferric salt and potassium ferricyanide, exposed to light, and rinsed with water to fix the image. Although White made many cyanotypes, the technique was mainly used for copying plans and drawings, which led to the more common term \"blueprint.\"</P></SPAN>",
