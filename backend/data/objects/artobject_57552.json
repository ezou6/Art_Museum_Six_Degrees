The people of the area say that it was painted in the early part of this dynasty, however, they do not know who brushed it. Bowing twice, its heroic and imposing character and bold brushwork appears as if it has spiritual force, possibly not something that mundane craftsmen can attain. After two hundred years, the wall is without [even] minor losses, letting us know that there is something that has protected it. Today, I have obtained a rubbing copy, [had it carved], and erect it in the Yuxu Guan temple in Longquan. \r\nNotes:\r\n1. Yuxu Guan 玉虛觀 temple is located in at Mt.

He faces forward with fierce eyes and in front holds a downward-pointing sword etched with the seven stars of the Dipper on the blade. Below, in two parts on the right and left is a clerical-script inscription. The right section notes that this is a copy based on a rubbing of stone in the Xiangfu Guan 祥符觀 monastery, Fuzhou 撫州, Jiangxi province, which was recarved and erected in the Yuxu Guan 玉虛觀 temple in Longquan, Pingwu 平武 county, in northern Sichuan province. The left section of the inscription seems to indicate that the earlier model was a pictorial stone raised in 1170 by an official named Qi. The inscription also notes that the recarving was done some 200 years after 1170, which would date the recut stone to the late 14th century during the Ming dynasty. ",
