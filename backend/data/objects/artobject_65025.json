Coburn’s early impressionistic cityscapes captured the evening light, when a mixture of street lamplight and the night air enveloped the city in a romantic, hazy fog. His interest in atmosphere rather than detail, as well as his developing concern for geometry and a desire to eliminate the horizon line, would eventually lead him to produce some of the first eentirely nonrepresentational photographs.</P></SPAN></SPAN>",
