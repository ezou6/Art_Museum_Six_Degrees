Instead, Michals might be termed an expressionist who looked inward to explore the unseeable themes of life, death, sensuality, and innocence.</p><p>Death is the primary theme of Michals’s work, of which he says, “I was the first person who, rather than photographing a corpse to capture death, rather than photographing in a funeral home or a cemetery—those are the facts—I want to know what happens when you die. . . . Critics didn't know what to write about it. It was conceived of as being flawed because there wasn't a decisive moment.” Although Michals has said that AIDS did not touch his own life deeply, works like this one are often seen in the context of the AIDS crisis.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
