She used a right-angle viewfinder, which positions the photographer’s gaze away from their subject, to surreptitiously capture street scenes in Harlem and the Lower East Side, where cramped apartments compelled residents to spend more time in public spaces. In <i>New York</i> she poetically references the ephemerality of childhood through the fragile bubbles that float away from the children who made them, while underscoring the  vulnerability of each in their environment of asphalt, concrete, and stone.\n</p>",
