In <i>The Gold at Grandmother’s Post</i>, the artist hangs quilting fabric from the frame of a bedpost mounted on a washboard as a tribute to the generations of quilt-makers in his family. Loosely anthropomorphic, the assemblage also contains a figurative painting of two conversing faces that suggests the artwork’s status as a conversation among various materials, techniques, and traditions.\n</p>",
