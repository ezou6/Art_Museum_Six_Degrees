These are cartes de visite, photographs printed at a standard size and mounted on cards in a form that allowed individuals to collect and trade images of both friends and celebrities. In this album, as was typical of the era, photographs of the family and friends of the album’s original owner share pages with images of political figures, including Abraham Lincoln, Sojourner Truth, and Frederick Douglass, as well as important individuals in the abolitionist movement and anti-slavery leaders, such as William Lloyd Garrison, Lucretia Mott, Salmon P. Chase, Anna E. Dickinson, Wendell Phillips, Theodore Tilton, and George Truman. The majority of these images were taken by the Philadelphia photographer John White Hurn, and it is plausible that this album was put together in that city. While we have no further clues about the album owner’s identity, they seem to have held strong anti-slavery sentiments. </p><p><br></p>",
