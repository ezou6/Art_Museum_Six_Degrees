            "textentryhtml":"\r\nGrounded in the academic tradition, Charles White is celebrated for his monumental and expressive drawings of his fellow African Americans. Like his paintings and prints, these works were motivated by White’s lifelong commitment to addressing subjects of black history and themes of racial injustice, while claiming that his art had \"a universality to it.\" This iconic portrait of the renowned singer, actor, and political activist Paul Robeson relates to White’s large multifigure mural <I>The Contribution of the Negro to Democracy in America</I>, which he painted in 1942–43 at the historically black Hampton University in Virginia. Inspired by Mexican muralists such as Diego Rivera, the work proclaimed a sweeping and polemical panorama of African American accomplishments in history, science, and the arts. This drawing may have served both as a detailed study to which White referred when painting the figure of Paul Robeson in the mural and as an independent teaching model for Hampton students. In its exquisitely modulated linear network of charcoal and carbon pencil that molds the planes and furrows of Robeson’s head and face, the drawing transcends its category of portrait study, breaking free from the crowded struggle against racism depicted in the Hampton mural to resonate as an inspirational presence. </P></SPAN>",

He was one of the most successful and influential figures of the twentieth century. Although best known as an actor for his role in the musical Show Boat, with its poignant anthem “Ol’ Man River,” and for his legendary performance as the first African American cast as Shakespeare’s Othello, he was a Renaissance man who received wide recognition as a cultural scholar, outstanding athlete, lawyer, author, and political activist. Mostly, Mr. Robeson was a leader in the war against racism in America and fascism abroad. He stated, “Through my singing and acting and speaking I want to make freedom ring. Maybe I can touch people’s hearts better than I can their minds, with the common struggle of the common man.”\n</p>\n<p><b>\n\tShirley A.
