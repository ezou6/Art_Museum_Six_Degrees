Diya is in charge of the register recording the fate of scholars and students but is here shown carrying a qin instrument, while Baite is portrayed as an older man with a sword atop a large case, containing the deity’s large seal, strapped to his back. The trio has just journeyed through the Wind Cave in Mount Qiqu, which according to legend provided the deity with a magical passageway from his base in Zitong county, Sichuan, to the capital thousands of miles away. Wenchang dijun has traditionally been appealed to by writers and scholars in need of inspiration or help before an exam.</p><p>The name of the cave is inscribed above the entrance, and to the left is a waterway with hills and distant mountains in the background. At center above the scene an area of paper that was not inked has been left for a large seal belonging to Zitong county. A title is added across the top in seal-script calligraphy, and a short inscription with the date and carver is appended at left. </p>",
