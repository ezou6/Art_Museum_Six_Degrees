Xianzao Ting 仙棗亭 (Pavilion of the immortal date) is also known as Lüxian Ting 呂仙亭 (Pavilion of the immortal Lü). It was built during the early Ming dynasty atop Snake Mountain (She shan 蛇山), Wuchang 武昌, Hunan province. In 1993 it was rebuilt near Huanghe Lou 黃鶴樓. There are stories of that there used to be date trees at this location that did bear fruit. A pavilion named “Hoping for dates” (pan zao 盼枣) was built. The next year the trees produced large dates that if eaten were believed to lead to immortality. The official sent guards and prepared a feast for himself, but the page-boy he had sent to pick the dates did not return. When they went to check on him, they discovered that he had eaten a date and already become immortal, and all the remaining fruit had fallen to the ground and became stone.

When the tower was renovated in 1880, the Liuxian Ting 留仙亭 pavilion was renamed Xianmei Ting 仙梅亭. (1880年,知府張德容在重建岳陽樓時,又將留仙亭復改為仙梅亭), so this panel must have been carved between 1867 and 1880.\r\n2. This inscription replaces Jiang Shaoyan’s inscription on the earlier pictorial carving (see PUAM y1958-266).",

The large date refers to the Pavilion of the Immortal Date (Xianzao Ting 仙棗亭), which marked an area where unfruitful date trees suddenly produced&nbsp; miraculously large dates that resulted in immortality if eaten. The two round coins with square openings symbolizes immortal enlightenment. Beneath the seal-script title across the top is inscribed the “Precious Admonitions of Patriarch Lu” 呂祖寶誥 as transcribed by Guanwen 官文 (1798-1871), a Manchu bondservant, general, and official. At left is an 1864 inscription by Wang Jie describes some of the symbols in the portrait and records that he had the pictorial stone from which this rubbing was taken carved after having rebuilt the Pavilion of the Immortal Date. An inscription dated 1867 appears at lower right. The inscription at bottom left indicates that this rubbing may have been taken from a later recarving on a wood panel that was kept in the Liuxian Ting 留仙亭 pavilion at the Yueyang Lou 岳陽樓 tower, in Yueyang, Hunan province. The figure is recarved so that in the rubbing the face, hands, and feet, along with the large date appear in white. ",
