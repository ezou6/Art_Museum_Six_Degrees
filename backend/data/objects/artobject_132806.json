He introduces a distance between himself and his subjects by taking this photograph from a window or balcony. The men, women, and children in the streets become a mass of light and dark that recedes down the avenue. In the title, Vishniac identifies the gestures of the crowd as the Nazi salute. His effort to picture the hateful intentions of this group runs up against the mundane appearance of the street demonstration, requiring the viewer’s close attention to the caption and details. This conflict between the ideology that the group represents and the banality of the scene raises important questions about our ability to recognize evil in the everyday.</P></SPAN>",
