As a staff photographer for <em>Life</em> magazine, he published many photo-essays, including “How It Feels to Be Black” (1963). Based on his first novel, a semiautobiographical story of an African American boy growing up in Parks’s hometown of Fort Scott, Kansas, the photo-essay illustrates experiences both positive, such as the moment of summertime leisure pictured here, and negative, including the impact of racism on the boy’s family. Through his work for <em>Life</em>, Parks offered readers a personal point of entry for the issue of racism, presented in ways they could relate to and empathize with. ",
