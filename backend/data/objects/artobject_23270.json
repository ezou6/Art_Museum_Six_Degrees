Jackson preserved and strengthened the unified states but justified slavery and the violent displacement of Native Americans. In 1834 Frazee sculpted a clay bust of Jackson at the White House, from which a mold was created to cast replicas in plaster such as this, now the only known example. Frazee must have hoped to attract a commission to reproduce the bust in marble, his favored medium, but none materialized, perhaps because his flattering likeness failed to emphasize Jackson’s most recognized feature—the long, narrow face consistently seen in other representations of “Old Hickory,” as Jackson was known.\n",
