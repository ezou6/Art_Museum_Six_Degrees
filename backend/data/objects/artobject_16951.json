Attached to cords, they are used for hanging a purse, pouch, or other object from the sash (obi) that serves as a belt in traditional Japanese dress. Nestuke were originally designed for men and commonly used with <I>sagemono</I>, or hanging containers, to carry writing kits, seal cases, or tobacco and pipes. Women also eventually adopted netsuke, which they attached to small purses. The netsuke would be left hanging outside the sash, enabling them to be easily located and to serve as attractive accessories. These small items expressed the individual sartorial taste of their wearers, and, after becoming popular export items for foreign collectors, they gradually took on more complex and intricate appearances, as seen here.</P></SPAN>",
