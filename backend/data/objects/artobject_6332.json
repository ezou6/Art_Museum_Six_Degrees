In this case, Stella used a range of unmixed or \"pure\" acrylic paints; variations in hue and intensity create a sense of optical play. Some elements in the painting appear to project, while others seem to recede. Separated by thin pencil lines, the bands of color comprise a network of interwoven shapes, which in turn form three nested squares. As an undergraduate at Princeton University, Frank Stella took classes in studio art, but he majored in art history, completing his senior thesis on medieval Irish, Carolingian, and Ottonian art in 1958. Later that same year, he moved to New York and began the <I>Black Paintings</I> that launched his career. Stella’s innovative use of flat, ready-made colors, austere shapes, and deductive compositions exerted a formative influence on Minimalist sculpture.</P></SPAN>",

Such formal devices were novel for Stella, who moved to New York City in 1958, the year he graduated from Princeton University, and began his series of Black Paintings—freehand, symmetrical arrangements of black stripes in commercial enamel paint that seemed to resist subject matter and personal expression. In contrast to those early works, Stella’s <i>Protractor </i>series, to which this painting belongs, explores complex constructions of pictorial space through compositions of tightly interlocking forms at a monumental scale, opening a new chapter in the artist’s career.\n",
