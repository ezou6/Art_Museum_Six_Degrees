Puryear&nbsp;uses this wagon to remember slavery as an institution of haunting burden, from which some were able to find liberation. At the same time, the cart may refer to the colonial trade among Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States, which was the basis of the economy of slavery. Thus, the commanding presence of the cart in the work can also be seen as a reappropriation of a tool of oppression. The eerie, sepia-colored haze of the background encourages the use of a critical lens to confront America’s shameful history.</p><p><br><strong><em>Amy Amatya, Class of 2021</em></strong><br></p>",
