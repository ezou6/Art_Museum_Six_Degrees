            "textentryhtml":"Popular in the 1860s and ’70s, a tintype is a durable and low-cost photograph made by creating a direct positive image on a thin sheet of enameled metal. Due to the affordability of the tintype process, it became popular in the United States as a medium of portraiture. Tintype portraits from the mid- to the late nineteenth century capture a wide range of settings and subjects. This image shows a barely visible Black man whose face is obscured by a dark, tilted hat, holding in his lap an infant dressed in light-colored garments. In the mid-nineteenth century, parents were often brought into the photo studio to soothe their frightened or fidgety children so that they would hold still for the camera. Historians have termed this phenomenon “hidden mother” photography because the accompanying adult was often covered by curtains or drapes so as not to distract attention from the infant’s portrayal. A similar compositional strategy is at work in this photograph, which hides the Black man’s identity and makes his form nearly indistinguishable from the dark backdrop. The sharp visual contrast between the two figures invites the viewer to think about the possible relationships between them. Did the man commission this portrait himself? Did the child belong to him? Who else would have wanted to own this photograph? ",
