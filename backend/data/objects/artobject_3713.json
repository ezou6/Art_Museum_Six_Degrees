Serving as a pretext for the display of idealized male nudes, the scene showed a moment before the battle, when a group of Florentine soldiers was surprised by the Pisan army while bathing in the Arno River. Derived from the left portion of<br>the cartoon, Raimondi’s engraving features three bathers, one of whom reaches down to help a fourth out of the water. Raimondi appropriated the landscape background from a recent print by the Netherlandish artist Lucas van Leyden.",
