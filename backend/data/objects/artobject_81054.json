Part of the experience of this painting arises from its floating veils of color, which seem to vibrate against one another and off the paper. After an early pursuit of mythical and surreal imagery that he shared with the artist Adolph Gottlieb, Rothko experimented with stacked rectangles, which he believed transcend their chromatic relationships to communicate such human emotions as ecstasy and doom.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1968, after a near-fatal aneurysm led his doctor to forbid Rothko from making paintings more than 40 inches tall, he created nearly 120 intimately scaled paintings on paper, including <i>Untitled</i>. The work is displayed alongside Rande Cook’s composition of curvilinear forms that evokes the cedar screen inside a Kwakwaka’wakw family dwelling. With red and white blocks of color, Cook combines the visual language of post–World War II abstract painting and the stylistic traditions and techniques of the Indigenous Pacific Northwest coast.\n</p>",
