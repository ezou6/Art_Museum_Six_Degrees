This is also the name given to the period during which they appear. Haniwa ranged in form from simple hollow tubes to figures of people and animals, and even complex architectural structures. Plain cylinders are characteristic of the earliest burial sites, while figural haniwa, such as this one adorned with necklace, earring, and belt, appeared only after the fifth century. The intended function of haniwa is still debated. One theory suggests that they served to mark and protect the boundary between the realms of the living and the dead.

Traces of white pigment are still visible on the headdress, arms, and necklace, suggesting they were originally painted.\n",
