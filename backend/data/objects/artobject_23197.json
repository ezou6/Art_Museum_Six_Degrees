Portraits of Washington were in great demand, but, seeking to distance himself from the self-promotion typically associated with monarchs, the first president was notoriously unwilling to pose for artists. Works that were based on sittings thus gained a particularly authoritative voice in characterizing the man—and, by extension, the nascent American republic. Rush cast this bust in plaster after a terracotta original, creating multiple copies to meet popular demand. Likely the only surviving replica directly produced by the artist, it is believed to have belonged to Thomas Jefferson and thus is evidence of the close network of relationships among early American influencers. It is to the tradition of portraits such as this example that Titus Kaphar, whose work is on view nearby, responds.",
