He is flanked by the seated allegorical figures of Justice (on the left) and Charity (on the right) shown with two children. Above the effigy hovers a pair of trumpeting putti, signifying Fame and holding a helmet and shield. In its composition, the drawing relates closely to a series of Bernini designs for papal tombs from the 1650s and 1660s. Although the identity of the deceased is unknown, one possible candidate is Tommaso Rospigliosi (1642–1669), beloved nephew of Bernini’s patron Pope Clement IX, and who held several honorary military offices before his premature death from malaria.</SPAN></P></SPAN>",
