Romney’s use of a strikingly dark, nearly opaque wash evokes the robe’s rich and heavy material—likely velvet—and the areas of paper that Romney left bare reflect the clean white of the man’s shirt, stockings, and breeches. What appears to be a sketchily rendered globe on the table likely would have been intended to signify the sitter’s intellectual status.",
