Although the sitters’ nondescript \"portrait dress,\" characteristic of period imagery, and the similarly generic setting in which they are placed impart a timelessness to the scene, its intergenerational aspect is underscored by the spatial arrangement and poses of the subjects, particularly their linked hands and arms, which collectively suggest a circle moving clockwise from eldest to youngest sitter, as if to subtly indicate the march of time across the family’s history. Such an impression is bolstered by the background’s complementary transition from dark to light, by the gradually increasing brightness of the progressively younger subjects’ clothing, and by the heightened legibility and display of their youthful bodies, pictorially signifying their greater vitality.</P>\r\n</P></SPAN>",

Calhoun termed the “peculiar institution” of slavery. Calhoun first used that insidious euphemism in 1830 to defend the use of enslaved labor while serving as Vice President of the United States. He grew up near Edgefield, South Carolina, the site of the manufactory where the enslaved artisan known as Dave later made masterful stoneware vessels such as the one displayed here. The Hartley Family also derives from slavery: the four generations of related women it depicts in lavish dress and surroundings—arranged clockwise from oldest to youngest to suggest the durability of their world—were members of a coastal plantation family whose great wealth was enabled by the same system of human bondage that produced the humble jar.\n",
