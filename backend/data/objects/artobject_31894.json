Like the chair beside it, the chiffonier was used in the Rohlfs home, although another, closely related example was widely seen by visitors to the Pan-American Exhibition, held in 1901 in Buffalo, New York, where the family lived. It is distinguished by the expressive, Art Nouveau-inspired carving of its side panels and revealed through-tenon construction, with large vertical keys holding the tenons in place and providing a rhythmic decorative element. The use of richly grained oak was typical of Rohlfs’s production and that of Arts and Crafts furniture makers, generally.",
