The addition of a title that puts words into the mouth of the sitter was derived from the captions of illustrated fiction and already adopted by painters such as William Merritt Chase, whose title <I>I Think I Am Ready Now</I> (ca. 1883) similarly voices the hidden thoughts of an attractive female subject. Characteristically, White picked the moment of thought rather than action, which allowed him to place his sitter in a stable pose for the lengthy interior exposure. </P><I>\r\n<P dir=ltr align=left>A Rift in the Clouds</I>, included on the wall behind McCune, is a radically abstract image that most photographers would have discarded. All that is visible is the silhouette of dark trees against a mid-gray sky and a band of illumination, faintly reflected in a creek on the left. White, who later boasted that he did everything that the manuals said you shouldn’t do, such as shooting toward the light, could have seen reproductions of James McNeill Whistler’s painted or etched <I>Nocturnes</I>, in which shadowy bridges and shorelines were set off against lighter expanses of water. By 1896, many European and American artists were invoking the irrational mystery of nighttime, but few obliterated halftones and flattened forms to the extent that White did. </P></SPAN>",
