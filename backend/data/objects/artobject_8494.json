Having received an extensive classical education in his native Zurich, Fuseli traveled throughout Germany before arriving in London in 1765. There, he joined a circle of academic painters that included Sir Joshua Reynolds and George Romney, who were intent on establishing a dramatic style of British history painting based on literary sources. Fuseli’s knowledge of archaic British and Germanic literature coincided with the recent availability of eighteenth-century publications of the collected works of John Milton and William Shakespeare, as well as rediscovered medieval manuscripts, translated and annotated for modern readers and scholars. </P></SPAN>",
