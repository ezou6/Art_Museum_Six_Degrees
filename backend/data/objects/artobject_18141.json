After making this etching at the age of sixty-six, Cage became dedicated to printmaking for the remainder of his life. The image duplicates the composer’s conducting score for his 1974 musical composition <EM>Score (40 Drawings by Thoreau) and 23 Parts</EM>, inspired by the writings of American naturalist Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862). Here each of the twelve bars of the score has been divided into three sections of five, seven, and five measures, recalling the number of syllables in Japanese Haiku poetry. Cage has replaced conventional musical notation with small drawings of natural elements, such as seeds, animal tracks, and nests. Reproduced from Thoreau’s journal, these images were selected and sequenced at random by Cage with the aid of the I Ching, an ancient Chinese divination text.",
