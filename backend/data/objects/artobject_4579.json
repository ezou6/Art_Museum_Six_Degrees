Avery abandoned the brushy paint application and detailing of his early technique to create works with smooth, flat areas of broadly modulated, vibrant color. Texture increasingly was conveyed by scratching onto the painted surface with a sharp object, reducing the illusion of depth and calling attention to the picture plane. Avery’s new aesthetic — spare and economical — operated in tandem with his sophisticated color harmonies and subtle orchestration of hue. His formal innovations had a profound influence on a succeeding generation of &shy;American&nbsp;artists, including Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman, who purchased <I>Red Umbrella</I> in 1946. </P></SPAN>",
