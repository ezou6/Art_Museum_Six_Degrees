Mary was the wife of the statesman and lawyer Reverdy Johnson. Though opposed to slavery, Reverdy represented the slave-owning defendant in the landmark Dred Scott case of 1857, which held that enslaved persons could not be considered citizens even in free states, a decision that contributed to the Civil War. Sully’s romantic image belies such worldly concerns, depicting Mrs. Johnson in a vaguely classical setting that imparts an air of timelessness to the scene. By contrast, the contemporary Jamaican American artist Renée Cox foregrounds the issue of race in the large photograph installed nearby. Cox substitutes Black men and women for white males in her restaging of Howard Chandler Christy’s 1940 painting Signing of the Constitution, which enshrines a document that counted enslaved people as three-fifths of a person and restricted voting to property-owning white men.\n",

Mary was the wife of Reverdy Johnson, U.S. attorney general, senator, and among the most celebrated lawyers of his day. Although personally opposed to slavery, he represented the slave-owning defendant in the infamous <I>Dred Scott</I> case, which confirmed the status of slaves as property and was a significant impetus to the Civil War. Sully’s romantic image of Mrs. Johnson typically betrays no hint of such worldly concerns, depicting her in an elegant and classicizing setting whose indistinctness imparts a desirable air of timelessness to the portrait, a formula that helped make the Philadelphia-based artist one of the most successful of the Jacksonian era. </P></SPAN>",
