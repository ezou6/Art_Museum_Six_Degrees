Here he is shown as a bareheaded and resolute monk of the Augustinian Order, which he had joined in 1506. The Latin inscription below the image implies that while Luther’s thoughts are eternal, Cranach’s image is ephemeral. Cranach also includes his personal insignia of a crowned winged serpent, which derived from the coat of arms conferred upon him by Elector Frederick the Wise in 1508. </P>\r\n<P dir=ltr align=left></P></SPAN>",
