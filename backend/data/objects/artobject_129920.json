The long exposure time necessary for this early photographic technique required the sitter to remain immobile for an extended period, and children were often held in order to keep them in a fixed pose. Nurses, maids, and enslaved women thus were often recorded in portraits commissioned by white families of their young children. This photograph was taken before the Civil War, by an unknown photographer in an unknown place, and we can only speculate about the experience of this woman. We do not know whether she was enslaved or free, the nature of the relationship between her and the child, or what brought her to sit for this photograph. </p><p>In <em>Camera Lucida</em>, the writer and theorist Roland Barthes describes the clash of intentions underlying the photographic encounter. The intense confrontation between this woman, who gazes at the viewer, and the camera raises similar considerations: Who did she know herself to be? How did she want others to see her? Who did the photographer think she was? How did the photographer want to portray her in this image?<br></p>",
