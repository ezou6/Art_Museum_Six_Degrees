Based on a drawing from the 1880s and cast in an edition of apparently less than twenty, it was accurately described by the artist as \"men represented as being on a carousal.\" Although the artist had not begun exhibiting his sculptures of cowboys and horses until 1895, he had for two decades been producing similar two-&shy;dimensional portrayals of the frontier, many widely reproduced as prints and illustrations.
