            "textentryhtml":"The Museum recently acquired an important collection of nineteen Mimbres bowls, which collectively exemplify the range and visual ingenuity of Mimbres painters. Geometric patterns play with the arcs of the vessel and impose other patterns, most notably four-part designs. Representations of local fauna, including bighorn sheep, birds, and lizards, at times float statically on white voids, yet often seem to move or gain a sense of mobility from the curved surface. Animals appear to inhabit and activate the shape of the vessel - we can read it as the ant lion larvae’s conical den or as the vast sky through which a bird soars.<br><br>\r\nAbrasion within many of the larger Mimbres bowls indicates they were used as serving vessels for liquid food - likely corn gruel - whereas smaller, hand-sized bowls suggest individual use. As indicated by the small holes in many Mimbres bowls, their function as a food vessel was intentionally negated. This was part of the process of repurposing the vessels for burial. As such bowls were often placed inverted over the head of the deceased, the holes may have symbolically served as conduits by which the soul could move from the terrestrial to other realms; such kill-holes can thus be compared to the <i>sipapu</i> that puncture the floors of Anasazi pit houses, a symbolic reference to the portal through which people emerged from the earth. <br><br>\r\nThe majority of the bowls recently acquired, including those illustrated here, were excavated in 1929 by Dr. Albert E. Jenks, an archaeologist from the University of Minnesota, at the Galaz Ruin, a Mimbres village that, at its peak, was inhabited by some three hundred people. The Galaz Ruin, unfortunately, has since been systematically looted and effectively destroyed. As a research institution, one of the Museum's primary goals is to preserve the past, including both physical remains and all available associated contextual information. The Galaz bowls are rich on both counts and thus an especially welcome addition to the Museum’s collection. <br><br>\r\n<i>Bryan Just, Peter Jay Sharp, Class of 1952, Curator and Lecturer, Art of the Ancient Americas</i>\r\n",
