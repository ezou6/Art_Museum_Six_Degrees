The Ming dynasty’s relatively long period of social stability and thriving economy created a boom in architectural building; palaces, worship halls, temples, and shrines were constructed, often lavishly decorated and furnished with sculptures made of wood, lacquer, and ceramic. Sometime in the middle of the Ming period, it became popular for private individuals to commission large ceramic sculptures, often in sets, for Buddhist and Daoist temples and shrines.</P>\r\nThis Guanyin figure may be one of the finest surviving examples of Ming-dynasty <I>sancai</I> ceramic sculpture. It is particularly important because the inscription names both the individual donor and the artisan Qiao Bin, and provides the location where the sculpture was made: Yangcheng county in present-day Shanxi province. </P></SPAN>",

A bodhisattva, or “enlightened being,” has chosen to forgo nirvana, the state of highest spiritual awakening that extinguishes all suffering, to remain in the world to help others attain salvation. As Buddhism attracted more believers in China, representations of Guanyin underwent significant transformations. In this sculpture, Indian and Chinese features are mingled together: the sitting position derives from the Indian “royal ease” (rajalilasana) posture, but the lionlike beast (hou) below the deity is a mythical Chinese animal that became associated with Guanyin during the Ming dynasty. In addition, the figure’s hairstyle, accessories, rocky pedestal, and armrest all derive from Chinese Buddhist iconography. The tricolor lead-glaze technique emerged during the seventh century in China with copper, iron, and manganese added to the base glaze to create the polychrome effect of green, amber, and cream.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tINCISED IN THE REAR OF THE BASE:\n <br />\n\tDonated by the benefactor Nanzhang Yi,\n\t<br />\n\tof Nanshi village, Yangcheng county,\n\t<br />\n\tin the thirteenth year of the Hongzhi reign [1500],\n\t<br />\n\twith the pious men of this hall, Liu Puming and Lian Fang.\n\t<br />\n\t[Made by] a craftsman of this district’s Eastern Gate, Qiao Bin.\n</p><p> </p>\n<p>\n\t陽城縣南石里\n\t<br />\n\t施主南張儀施\n\t<br />\n\t弘治十三年\n\t<br />\n\t本堂善人劉普明 廉方\n\t<br />\n\t本縣東関匠喬彬\n</p>",
