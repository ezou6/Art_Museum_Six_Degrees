By setting up multiple cameras side by side and releasing the shutters in quick succession, Muybridge was able to create photographs that reveal the intricacies of bodies in motion. He often reordered the resulting images to give a more perfect illusion of movement. This method of photography not only anticipated motion pictures—which would make their debut in 1888—but also proved important for scientific uses, allowing people to see how bodies work. Stop-motion photography is still used today to better understand movement for purposes such as the creation of prosthetic devices.</P></SPAN>",
