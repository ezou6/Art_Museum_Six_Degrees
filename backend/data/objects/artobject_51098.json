Conceptual artists privileged ideas over finished works of art and process over product. Methodical, austere, and emotionally restrained, LeWitt’s sculptures generally consist of three-dimensional grids in which he determined the measurements of the smallest unit first, then built out the overall extensions and shapes based on ratios and proportions. With his technique steeped in geometry and mathematics, LeWitt intended to relieve the artist from expressing personal subjectivity and allow for his works to be replicated widely. His approach could nevertheless be intuitive, absurd, and compulsive, often defying logic. “Conceptual artists,” LeWitt wrote in 1969, “are mystics rather than rationalists. They leap to conclusions that logic cannot reach.”",

Minimalism emphasized geometry and modularity, while Conceptualism privileged ideas over objects and process over product. Methodical, austere, and emotionally restrained, LeWitt’s sculptures generally consist of three-dimensional grids whose proportions are based on those of the smallest individual unit and whose overall configuration is deduced from predetermined ratios, as in the case with <I>Untitled</I>, created for LeWitt’s friend, the artist Fred Sandback. Such an approach was intended to relieve the artist from having to invent, compose, and express. Despite the complex mathematical calculations it entailed, though, this technique was too intuitive, absurd, and compulsive to merit the term logical. \"Conceptual artists,\" LeWitt wrote in 1969, \"are mystics rather than rationalists.
