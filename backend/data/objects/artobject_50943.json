By removing the image from its news context and presenting it as an art print, the artist introduced an emotional distance from political protest, exposing the ways media imagery desensitizes the public to violence. Critics have problematized Warhol’s selection of photographs like this one that perpetuate an image of victimized blacks, amplified by the print’s heightened contrast.",

Immediately following the publication of Moore’s photographs in <I>Life</I> magazine, on May 17, 1963, Warhol made more than a dozen silkscreened paintings incorporating them. The following year, he reversed and cropped Moore’s photograph for this print. These protests were considered a major turning point in the civil rights movement; the fact that protesters, including many young students, were met with violence by local law enforcement—revealed in widely circulated photographs, including Moore’s—elicited public outrage. This is one of very few works by Warhol that explicitly addresses the racialized political violence of the 1960s. Moore would later sue Warhol for unauthorized use of his images.</P></SPAN>",
