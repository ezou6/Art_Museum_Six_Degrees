Durand began his career as an engraver, and gravitated first to portraiture before ultimately achieving wide renown as both a theorist and a practitioner of American landscape painting. In 1855, he wrote the influential <I>Letters on Landscape Painting</I>, advocating direct study of nature through meticulous on-site oil sketches that could be combined into more ambitious studio compositions such as <I>Landscape</I>, in which the grandeur of American scenery was invested with allegorical meaning. Adopting in these idealized works compositional techniques codified by Claude Lorrain (1604–1682), including graduated spatial recession via diminishing formal elements and gradational tonal modulation, Durand presented the American wilderness as harmonious and logical, simultaneously suggesting its appeal and availability for productive development. As if to underscore this idea, <I>Landscape</I> incorporates a diminutive but central figure — appropriately attired in red, white, and blue — depicted walking into the inviting scene, much as contemporary Americans envisioned &shy;occupying the continent. </P></SPAN>",

            "textentryhtml":"Two Hudson River School paintings of the 1850s, each composed in a studio rather than directly observed outdoors, appear idyllic but offer distinct visions of the increasingly racialized American landscape. The diminutive figure in Asher Durand’s painting—appropriately attired in red, white, and blue—strides into the wilderness unfolding before him as a visual correlate of Manifest Destiny, the expansionist rhetoric that justified America’s territorial growth at the expense of Native Americans. The composition’s alternating, wedge-like forms lead progressively from the darker tones in the foreground into the light beyond, effectively presenting the American environment as logical, harmonious, and accessible. The landscape by Robert Duncanson, an African American who was actively engaged in Abolitionist causes, features three small figures subtly but intentionally rendered in discrete white, brown, and black skin tones, suggesting—in contrast to the settler colonialism conjured by Durand—a utopian America of harmonious and congenial racial relations.\n",
