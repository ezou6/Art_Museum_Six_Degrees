Hiroshige made his celebrated series <i>Fifty-Three Stations of the Tōkaidō</i> in 1833, after traveling this important route and sketching sites along the way. The Tōkaidō, or “Eastern sea route,” was a three-hundred-mile road with fifty- five official stops or stations, connecting the two most important cities of Edo Japan: Kyoto and Edo (present-day Tokyo). Eisen produced a set of Tōkaidō road prints, including the figure of a courtesan in front of Mount Fuji that you see in this group. The most renowned artist of the period, Hokusai produced his well-known print of figures crossing a suspension bridge for a series on provincial bridges, both real and imagined.\n",
