            "textentryhtml":"Picasso created some of his most powerful and innovative prints at the height of his Surrealist phase, preceding the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The artist saw the Minotaur—a creature from Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a man, driven by its unbridled animal instinct—as an allegorical alter ego. At the time, Picasso’s young mistress was pregnant, and he was captivated by the promise of new life within her. On the left of this print, a young girl holds aloft a lit candle to stop the advance of the Minotaur. Between them, a female matador is draped over her disemboweled horse, completing the artist’s elaborate autobiographical metaphor, in which Picasso, in the guise of a Minotaur, is confronted by his wife, his mistress, and his future child. In 1936 the artist gave this rare signed proof to his friend Alfred Barr (Princeton Graduate School Class of 1924), the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, who described this work as \"the greatest single print thus far produced in this century.\" ",

All of these themes are elaborately entwined in <I>Minotauromachy</I>, whose title is a clever wordplay on <I>La Tauromaquia</I>, Goya’s masterful suite of etchings, published in 1819, depicting the history and horrors of bullfighting. </P>\r\nIn Classical mythology, the Minotaur was a monster with the body of a man and the head of a bull that represented unbridled animal instinct. For Picasso, the creature represented an alter ego, combining both man and beast in a Freudian division of conscious and subconscious selves. In this work of strong contrasts, the figures appear in a shallow, stage-like space, as if in a dream. On the dark, left-hand side, an innocent girl with flowers is watched from above as she bravely holds aloft a lighted candle to stop the raging Minotaur from advancing on the right. The monster stands over a female matador lying astride her disemboweled horse, while shielding his eyes from the candle’s blinding light. When this print was made, the artist’s mistress, the young Marie-Thérèse Walter, was pregnant with his child. In Picasso’s autobiographical allegory, the Minotaur as a beast has brought death to the woman matador, but the purity of the new life within his lover halts the man within the monster whom the bullfighter failed to slay.</P>\r\nIn 1936, the artist gave this rare signed proof to his friend Alfred Barr, founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, on the condition that he keep it for his personal collection. In 1947, Barr wrote that he believed <I>Minotauromachy</I> \"to be the greatest single print thus far produced in this century.\" </P></SPAN>",
