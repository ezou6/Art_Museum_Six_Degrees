            "textentryhtml":"<p>Paintings of this Old Testament subject are relatively rare. The young Dutch Republic saw many parallels between its struggle to free itself from Spain and the Israelites of the Bible. The crossing of the Red Sea from the Book of Exodus, by which the Jews escaped from their Egyptian oppressors, was a moment of historical rupture that made possible their invention of a new collective identity. The story also prefigured the baptism of Christ and came to symbolize Christian baptism in general—a sign of God’s promise to forgive sin. For Calvinists, this story might have demonstrated the necessity of divine providence for spiritual salvation.</p><p>This painting and<em> Meeting of Jacob and Esau</em> share a history as far back as 1788 when they were in “a private contract sale” in England. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that they were conceived as pendants. The similarities in dimension might be explained by the fact that seventeenth-century panels were produced in standard sizes. Many of Cornelis’s paintings from about 1594 share an oblong format, which was well suited to narrative works with numerous figures. The similarity in their style—smaller panels, less exaggerated musculature of the figures, and warmer, less acidic coloring—is due to their simultaneous production and broadly describes Cornelis’s later works.</p><p><br></p>",

When they arrived at the Red Sea, God parted the waves to let them cross safely, as shown here; the closing waves behind them destroyed the pursuing Egyptian army while the Israelites continued on their journey toward the Promised Land. This foundational story of migration was later used by the Dutch Calvinists of the Northern Netherlands as a metaphor for their liberation from Spanish occupation, and by African American abolitionists as a symbol of their aspirations in the spiritual “Go Down, Moses.” </p><p><br><em>Betsy Rosasco, Research Curator of European Painting and Sculpture, 2018</em><br></p>",
