            "textentryhtml":"Roy Lichtenstein’s<i> Still Life </i>is a tightly cropped scene of objects on a table, rendered in a style made famous by the artist in the 1960s at the height of the Pop Art movement, which mined pop culture and mass media for influences. Lichtenstein famously borrowed imagery from comic books, cropping and isolating details and reproducing them with paint on large canvases. Due to printing constraints, the colors and tones in comics were usually rendered in tiny, barely perceptible dots. Lichtenstein enlarged these mechanical artifacts of mass media printing processes, raising questions about the role of the artist’s hand and his means of representation. Drawn in simple outlines with schematic shading, the objects in<i> Still Life</i> are at times ambiguous. Is it a vase or a carafe at left? An apple or glass at right? Lichtenstein thus pushed this schematic style of representation to its limits, bordering on abstraction.\n",
