Anonymous, Qinghe neizhuan 清河内傳 (Esoteric Biography of Qinghe) (Yuan dynasty), Zhengtong daozang 正統道藏 (Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Reign) ed. (1445), opening section. https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/清河內傳 \r\n- In the Qing dynasty, Ruan Yuan 阮元 (1764-1849) records that there was a stele for 英显武烈忠佑广济王 in the Wenchang Ci shrine in Hangzhou. At the top was carved the opening section of the Qinghe neizhuan in standard-script calligraphy, below was a picture of Zhang Yazi [i.e., personification of Wenchang], and next to it a short inscription with the date 1177. If correct, this would date the Qinghe neizhuan text to before the Yuan period, but was this so? It was thought that the Qinghe neizhuan must postdate Song because know one knew about the stele and because certain sections of the later editions are dated to the Yuan dynasty, but these are supplemental sections that could have been added. \r\nSee Wang Xingping 王兴平, “Liu Ansheng yu Wenchang jing” 刘安胜与文昌经\r\nhttp://www.chinataoism.org/showtopic.php?id=173 \r\n据阮元《两浙金石志》记载，杭州吴山梓潼帝君祠(文昌祠)曾经刻立“英显武烈忠佑广济王像碑”(宋高宗绍兴二十九年加封张亚子“英显武烈忠佑广济王”)，上层刻楷书《清河内传》，下层雕张亚子像，旁镌“淳熙丁酉六月会稽陈师中钱塘刻”11。可见，南宋孝宗淳熙四年(丁酉，１１７７)即有《清河内传》行世，也许尚非初出时间。\r\n\t学术界多认为此传“出于元明之际”，理由是传后有晚至元仁宗延祐三年七月的《加封宝诏》、《加封庙额》等。今见《清河内传》刻本的确如此，但这些都是下文的附录，为后来补加的。之所以认为该传出于元明间，定是由于未见《英显武烈忠佑广济王像碑》而误认为该传附录与正文产生于同一时间之故。该碑所镌《清河内传》只有正文，镌刻时间为“淳熙丁酉六月”，这就证明正文和最后的附录分别是宋元两个不同朝代的产物。\r\n- Louis Komjathy, “Daoist Texts in Translation,” Centre for Daoist Studies website (2003), p. 27 https://web.archive.org/web/20110717124726/http://www.daoistcenter.org/texts.pdf  \r\nQinghe neizhuan 清河內傳: Esoteric Biography of Qinghe: DZ 169.\r\n1a-2b translated by Terry F.

During the twelfth century, this earlier Sichuanese viper cult figure was identified with Wenchang 文昌, the God of Literature, who became the central figure of a national cult and the patron of civil service examinations. Qinghe 清河 refers to a town in Hebei province whose residents were associated with a temple dedicated to Zitong since the 4th century. The text explains how Zitong undertakes a process of self-cultivation and merit-building before attaining godhood.”\r\n",

            "textentryhtml":"<p>At bottom is the scene of Wenchang 文昌, the god of literature and culture, riding his white donkey while looking back over his shoulder at soldier approaching from right. Accompanying Wenchang on foot are two attendants carrying travel packs on their backs, and a dog trots along below. In the dream-cloud that rises from the deity’s head are two small figures, male and female, riding a snake, which recalls Wenchang’s early beginnings as a local viper cult figure in Zitong 梓潼, Sichuan. Later, the deity was anthropomorphized into the war hero Zhang Yazhi 張亞子, who lived during the fourth century. After his death, he was re-embodied 73 times as a benevolent official and in the twelfth century, this figure became identified with Wenchang, who was the patron of civil service examinations, and whose popularity grew nationwide. At the right of the scene is a short inscription that Chen Shizhong had this stone carved in1177.</p><p><br>Above the pictorial scene is a heading in large clerical script and an inscription written in standard-script calligraphy. The heading joins the “Yingxian wulie wang” 英顯武烈王 title that the Northern Song dynasty Emperor Zhenzong 真宗conferred to Wenchang in 1001 with the titles “Zhongyou” 忠佑and “Guangji” 廣濟 bestowed during the Southern Song Shaoxing reign (1131-1162). The inscription text outlines how Wenchang practiced self-cultivation and attained merit before deification. This inscription was included at the beginning of the Qinghe neizhuan 清河内傳 (Esoteric Biography of Qinghe), an anonymous text that gathers together a group of works (with some supplementary materials dating to the Yuan dynasty) about the Divine Lord of Zitong (Zitong dijun 梓潼帝君, i.e., Wenchang). The pictorial stone from which this rubbing was taken was recorded as being in the Zitong dijun Ci 梓潼帝君祠 (Wenchang Ci 文昌祠) shrine in Hangzhou by the Qing dynasty scholar-official Ruan Yuan 阮元 (1764-1849) in his Liang Zhe jinshi zhi 兩浙金石志.&nbsp; <br></p>",
