Throughout his career, Stella has vigorously tested the formal and physical possibilities of abstract art, eliminating traditional representational references to accentuate the creative process in his innovative painting and print series. He titled the prints of his <EM>Exotic Bird Series</EM> after rare birds from around the world, while deriving the exotic shapes in these compositions from antique drafting templates.",
