Here his grandeur is underscored by a regal and arresting pose; his four hands hold his traditional attributes: mace (gadā), flaming discus (cakra), conch (śaṅkha), and a small lotus flower (padma). His lower right hand opens in a gesture (mudrā) that offers refuge to those seeking it. This feature, along with the figure’s downcast eyes and subdued smile, are perhaps meant to suggest the deity’s benevolence. Offering further testimony of his affection for his devotees, he is flanked by attendants and<br />two consort goddesses—Lakṣmī holds a fly whisk at his right and Sarasvatī plays the vīṇā on his left. His mount, Garuḍa, kneels below in a prayerful pose.</p><p>Vineet Chander, Assistant Dean, Office of Religious Life,<br />Director of Hindu Life Program, Princeton University</p>",

In his four hands he holds his primary attributes: a jewel, a conch, a flaming wheel, and a mace. The conch is a symbol of creation, the wheel symbolizes cosmic law, and the mace represents the power of the law. The jewel is a symbol of the fulfillment of the law, and the hand that holds it is extended in the <I>mudra</I> of wish fulfillment. Lakshmi holds a fly whisk in her right hand, while her left hand, now lost, probably held a lotus flower. &shy;Sarasvati plays a lute. Diminutive figures standing to either side of the two goddesses are personifications of a mace (<I>gadha</I>) and a flaming wheel (<I>chakra</I>). All five primary figures stand on lotus blossoms. In the lower register, Vishnu’s winged mount, Garudha, who kneels reverently with his palms pressed together, is accompanied on either side by devotees of Vishnu. \r\nThe pentad is ensconced in Vishnu’s mandorla, the top of which is lost. At the sides is a pair of leaping mythical beasts (<I>shardulas</I>) with lions’ bodies and composite heads supported by elephants. Each <I>shardula</I> is ridden by a youth, while other figures attempt to reign in the beasts. At the upper sides of the mandorla, two heavenly beings, one playing an instrument, herald the presence of the deity. </P></SPAN>",
