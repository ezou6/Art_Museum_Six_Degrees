Made from a copper alloy, this piece is comprised of a flat blade, a short handle, and an elaborate finial presenting interaction between two supernatural characters. One is an anthropomorphic deity with a serpent-tail and a feline headdress. His left hand gestures toward the other figure, while the right wields an atlatl (spear-thrower) and a dart. He faces an anthropomorphic feline who wears a large back-rack with a pair of human heads dangling from the upper structure. In ceremony, Mochica actors would often don the costumes of deities; the feline and atlatl-wielder on this chisel are thus either the supernaturals themselves or the ritual practitioners in costume. Presumably, these chisels were used to pierce the jugular of a sacrificial victim; the blood was then collected in a cup or bowl for offertory consumption before the victim was decapitated. </P></SPAN>",

The human’s left hand gestures toward the feline, while the right is cocked back, holding a spearthrower and dart. The feline stands on its hind legs like a human and wears a large back-rack with two dangling human heads.<BR><BR>Scholars have hypothesized recently that such chisels were used to pierce the jugular of a sacrificial victim; the blood was then collected in a cup or bowl for consumption before the victim was decapitated. Depictions of this Sacrifi ce Scene on Mochica pots indicate that actors donned costumes of deities; the feline and the man on the chisel are either the gods themselves or ritual practitioners in costume. Might this scene of fearsome, violent supernatural creatures have been made with the sacrifi cial victim as its intended audience? If so, we could imagine the sacrificant providing his victim with an intimate, private viewing, turning the chisel in his hand to reveal the realm of supernatural violence he was about to enter.",

Building on earlier traditions of hammering and soldering thin sheets of silver or gold, the Mochica added lost-wax casting of bronze as well as a technique known as depletion gilding (and silvering). Using naturally occurring acids, Mochica metalworkers could remove copper from the surface of metal objects that also contained gold or silver, leaving a thin layer of these more prized materials. Gold and silver were generally reserved for jewelry and other objects for the highest-ranking individuals, while copper alloys were more common among lower-ranking groups.</P>",
