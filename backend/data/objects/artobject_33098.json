Built from a composition of nine squares, each of which possesses subtle tonal differences resulting from the artist’s addition of small amounts of red, green, or blue to black pigment, these paintings explore the possibilities of perception within a restricted palette. Reinhardt attempted to remove any trace of brushwork from his canvases that might cause visual distraction—a goal that, paradoxically, required great effort. He thinned his paints with turpentine and drained the oil from the pigments to create delicate matte surfaces that capture and absorb light. As the artist once said, “Some people think that if a painting doesn’t have a subject or isn’t a picture, then it doesn’t have meaning. This just isn’t true.”",

This ambition was realized in his <I>Black Paintings</I>, which he began in the mid-1950s and described as the \"last painting[s] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. anyone can make.\" Unforgiving in its harmony and symmetry, <I>Untitled</I> consists of a roughly sixty-by-sixty-inch square divided into nine smaller squares of similar proportions. The tonal gradations between each square are so subtle that the painting appears at first glance to be an uninterrupted field of color. Reinhardt sought to eliminate all visual distractions as well as any trace of labor from his canvases — a goal that required, paradoxically, much effort to achieve. He also drained the oil from his pigments in order to create delicate matte surfaces that capture and absorb light.
