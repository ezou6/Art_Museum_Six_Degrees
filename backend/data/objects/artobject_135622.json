While most of the photographs show Ceriani with his patients, here he is portrayed alone. By focusing on a young physician who turned his back on city medicine, <em>Life</em> endorsed the redistribution of doctors to rural areas. Published in the September 20, 1948, issue, the essay addresses the challenges of medical care in remote communities, while implicitly criticizing compulsory health insurance—then promoted by President Harry Truman in his reelection campaign as part of a “Fair Deal” social-benefits package.",
