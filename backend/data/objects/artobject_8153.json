The others show scenes from French history and were made to be engraved for book illustrations. The present drawing was first called <EM>Scylla Presenting to King Minos of Crete the Head of Her Father</EM>, a scene from Ovid’s <EM>Metamorphoses</EM>. The art historian Jennifer Montagu, however, pointed out that Scylla gave Minos only the single lock of King Nisos’s hair that protected him and the city of Megara, while this woman’s servant carries a charger with an entire head. Montagu thus proposed that this drawing depicts Alexander the Great receiving the wife of Spitamenes, a warlord, who delivered her husband’s head to the general in his camp, ending the uprising in Sogdia and Bactria that Spitamenes had led. If this is a preparatory drawing for an illustration, it would probably be for an as-yet-unidentified book on Alexander the Great.",
