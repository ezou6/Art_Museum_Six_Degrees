Based on the inscription above the sitter’s head, the painting has been attributed to Nainsukh, one of the most widely celebrated artists of the Punjab Hills in northwestern India. His innovative work is distinguished by his mastery of portraiture; his absorption of Mughal painting techniques, including its methods for depicting depth; and his interest in Hindu subjects. Nainsukh’s tremendous ability to capture gesture and detail is seen here in his portrayal of a fleeting moment when the nobleman subtly touches his punch dagger, as though wishing to make a slight adjustment to its placement.",
