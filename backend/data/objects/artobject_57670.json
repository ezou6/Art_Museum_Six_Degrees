Wang Zhizuo of Jiangsu carved a [picture of “Su Shi Wearing a] Bamboo Hat and Clogs” and offered it to the Si Lu Kan niche/shrine. When [I, Lu] Wenjie was filling in as the Aide of Zhenze, a rubbing [of this portrait of Lu You] was presented and given to me. I stored it in a traveling case but over time it was lost. Today I understand that Zhao Guisheng in Chengdu also has this rubbing. When I had gone to pay my respects at the Shaoling Si shrine, I saw the lord [Lu You] being worshiped to the side. Shaolin [i.e., the poet Du Fu] had a carved statue as well as various portraits, but lord [Lu You] did not. . . . I desired this [portrait] and entrusted Yang Ziling to recopy and carve it into stone, and at the time of the lord [Lu You’s] birthday, gave it the [Du Fu] Cottage with a [seven-syllable] regulated verse poem comparing it to the Si Lu Kan shrine, only to make it more intimate. In winter of the renyin cyclical year of the Daoguang reign, respectfully recorded by the descendant Wenjie.” [draft translation]",

This is the portrait of Lu You 陸游 (1125-1210), a poet during the Southern Song dynasty. The poem and inscription are by his descendant Lu Wenjie who records that Yang Ziling recopied the portrait and carved it into stone in 1842 and he gave it to the Du Fu Cottage in Chengdu, Sichuan. Three patches of damage to the stone appear on the upper left half of the rubbing. The actual pictorial stone from which this rubbing was taken is now still housed in the Du Fu Cottage complex inside the Gongbu Si 工部祠 shrine hall. The surface of the stone has received significant further damage since the time this rubbing was made. ",
