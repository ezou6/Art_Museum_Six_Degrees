These examples belong to two groups of drawings by Tiepolo, which were acquired by Dan Fellows Platt in London in the 1920s and came from two albums that had been previously broken up. The smaller group consists of single, standing draped figures, while the larger group features figures foreshortened from below. As none of these sheets can be connected with a particular fresco, they probably functioned as a database of poses for figures standing or seated on clouds, which could then be drawn upon when a large ceiling project was undertaken by the studio.",
