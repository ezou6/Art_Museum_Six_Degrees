Strands of extraneous fiber float above and among the grid’s  cells, introducing disorder and tactility to a format more typically associated with order and standardization. Cotton—and its resonance with slave labor—spills out of the grid, suggesting the material histories that lie behind the seeming neutrality of  this abstract composition. While elements in Drew’s work might appear to be found objects, most of his materials are new or repurposed from previous artwork. “I don’t work with found objects because there is already a history embedded in the material,” he explains. “For me, I need to go through the rigor, touch it, get involved with it, transform the material.”\n",

Cotton, wood, rope, rags, and rust feature frequently in his work. In <EM>Number 25D</EM>, Drew constructs an asymmetrical grid—a foundational element of modern art—out of cotton fabric and thread. Strands of extraneous thread rest on top of and between the small squares that compose the grid, introducing disorder, vulnerability, and tactility to a format that is more typically associated with stability, science, and standardization. Rather than remain in a fixed position, cotton—and its resonance with slave labor—spills out of the grid, as if <BR>to suggest its irrepressible historicity.</P></SPAN>",
