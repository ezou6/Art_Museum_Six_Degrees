Ha! Ha!\r\nIf my expression is joyful I will feel less oppressed;\r\nWorldly troubles will be transformed into a joyful expression –\r\nTo feel oppressed on behalf of others in the end is of no help:\r\nThe great Dao can still emerge in the midst of happiness.\r\nIf the state is able to be happy, the sovereign and his ministers will unite in joy;\r\nIn a joyful reception hall father and son will join together.\r\nAbundant happiness among brothers lets the thorned tree flourish [reference to a story about a divided inheritance in which a Judas tree was chopped apart];\r\nIf husband and wife can be happy, they will harmonize like the Qin and Se [zithers].\r\nHow could host or guest tolerate a lack of pleasantness?\r\nIf superior and subordinate have joyful sentiments, differentiation will be all the more strict.\r\nHa! Ha! Ha!\r\nCommentary: Hanshan and Shide are incarnations of [the bodhisattvas] Puxian [Samantabhadra] and Wenshu [Mañjushrî]. What people refer to today as the harmony saints or joint saints are transformational manifestations of Hashan and Shide.\r\n[trans. by Jonathan Hay in Eccentric Visions: The Worlds of Luoping (2009), p. 174.] \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nBottom left:\r\n吳郡石師唐仁齋所作\r\nMade by the stone master Tang Renzhai of Wu prefecture.\r\nNotes:\r\n1.

            "textentryhtml":"<p>Two friends Hanshan and Shide were semi-mythical Chan monks of the Tang dynasty (618-906), who became popular subjects in Buddhist painting throughout East Asia. Hanshan (“Cold Mountain”) was an eccentric poet and is often shown holding a brush and an empty scroll. He befriended Shide (“Foundling”), an orphan who worked as a humble servant at the temple and is frequently depicted with a broom. With their wild hair, unkempt clothes, and carefree manners, the friends embody independence and inner peace even under the rigors of monastic discipline. <br></p><p>The pictorial stone from which this rubbing was made was carved by Tang Renzhai, and it is housed in the Hanshan Temple in Suzhou. The composition closely follows an original painting by the eccentric artist Luo Ping that is currently in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. Featured as a pair in both the painting and rubbing, the individuality of Hanshan and Shide are not clearly distinguished. One stands with his robe loosened, exposing his upper body, while the other looks up while at the same time points down with a hooked finger. In both works, overtop is the same inscription, probably composed by Luo Ping, and written in calligraphy that emulates the script style of the artist Zheng Xie (1693-1765), a friend of Luo’s in Yangzhou. <br></p>",
