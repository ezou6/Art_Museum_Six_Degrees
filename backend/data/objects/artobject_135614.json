During his two-month assignment, Smith followed Callen as she tirelessly cared for the poor and predominantly black community of Pineville, South Carolina. An Episcopalian missionary, Callen trained to be a registered nurse at Tuskegee University and the Georgia Infirmary before settling in Pineville, where she worked not only as a midwife and teacher but also, in the words of the text, as a “‘doctor,’ dietician, psychologist, bail-goer, and friend.”&nbsp; The essay’s opening sequence documented seventeen-year-old Alice Cooper’s labor and delivery of her child. In this unpublished lamplit scene, Maude (on the left) assists another midwife in administering an enema to the expectant mother. The other photograph, which appeared in a subsequent issue, shows Maude distributing clothes to a family whose home had been destroyed in a fire. The lengthy caption alludes to the many donations Maude received from Life readers in response to the 1951&nbsp;photo-essay; cash contributions enabled her to build a clinic.",
