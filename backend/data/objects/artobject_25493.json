As a young man he went to Rome and apprenticed with the artist Domenichino, whose work influenced other artists in the exhibition, such as Giovanni Battista Viola. As here, his landscape paintings recall the style of the <em>paesi con figure piccolo</em> (landscapes with small figures) popularized by the Carracci family in Bologna. In his mature period, Cozza worked side by side with other artists in the Wilder collection, such as Gaspard Dughet, who had in turn been a pupil of Nicolas Poussin, revealing the complex circles of exchange and influence in seventeenth-century Europe.</p><p><br></p>",
