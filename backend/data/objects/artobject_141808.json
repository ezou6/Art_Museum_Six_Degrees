The image indicates the photographer’s indebtedness to the New Objectivity movement in photography, which sought to depict objects in a sharp, realistic light. Like many photographers associated with this movement, which emerged in Germany in the 1920s, Zoetmulder sought to cultivate a language of photographic seeing. He once wrote, “Photography is a discrete and independent field with its own design principles . . .thus photography is distinct from other modes of expression such as painting.”\n</p>",
