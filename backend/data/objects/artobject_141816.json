            "textentryhtml":"<p>\n\tIn the 1990s, the Dashanzhuang neighborhood, located on the margins of Beijing, became a haven for radical artistic experimentation. Called “Beijing’s East Village” after the Manhattan neighborhood that became a thriving artists’ community, its former factories offered spaces of relative freedom in a society where avant-garde art was considered dissident and dangerous. Two of the most prominent artists in Beijing’s East Village were Rong Rong, who took these photographs, and Zhang Huan, who appears in them. Rong captured Zhang’s boundary-breaking performances, in which he tested the endurance and impact of the human body. To create <i>12 Square Meters</i>, Zhang coated his body in fish oil and honey and sat motionless in a public latrine while flies swarmed his body. As Rong wrote, even watching was excruciating: “Holding my camera, I felt that I couldn’t breathe, it felt like the end of life.” Rong’s close-up of Zhang’s hand offers a poignant detail from the performance <i>Metal Case</i>, in which Zhang locked himself in a cramped iron box for twentyfour hours. Rong captured the culmination of the physically draining performance <i>Primordial Sounds</i>, when Zhang leapt from an elevated highway, stuffed earth worms into his mouth, then lay down sobbing. In <i>To Raise the Water Level in a Fishpond</i>, dozens of migrant laborers join Zhang in a collective action. Rong’s photographs expand the audience for these performances, capturing a range of perspectives on bodies momentarily liberated by performative interventions.\n</p>",
