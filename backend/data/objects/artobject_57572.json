He holds a scroll and one talon-like finger with an elongated fingernail sticks out from a sleeve. At upper right is a popular poem wishing for the longevity for the country. At left, a 3-character inscription names the painter of the design with the nickname Three Pines (Sansong 三松). To the left is an inscription dating the copying and carving of the design in Tongzhou to 1572. A seal of the Tongzhou prefectural office is stamped at top center. At far left, there is a partial inscription, which may indicate that the stone in this area was damaged and the rubbing was made filling in the damaged area with black ink. This inscription may have identified the carver or carving agent.&nbsp; ",
