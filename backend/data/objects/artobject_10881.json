Working in an Impressionistic style that exhibited brilliant color and spontaneous brushwork, Zorn painted the portraits of three American presidents as well as important industrialists, socialites, and heads of state throughout Europe and the United States. He was also a prolific printmaker who made nearly three hundred etchings in his career. According to the artist, \"I devoted free moments, particularly evenings, to etching both reproductions and from life.\" Many of these prints were private, intimate views of his family, friends, and favorite models, boldly etched with a distinctively fluid line.</P></SPAN>",
