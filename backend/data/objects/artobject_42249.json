Writing connoted the transaction of commerce, law, correspondence, and other affairs considered gentlemanly, as seen in three of these portraits of accomplished American citizens. In contrast is a depiction of the successful published poet Annis Boudinot Stockton, a politically active correspondent of George Washington—and likely the most literate among the group. She is portrayed without reference to writing or other qualities that defined her public persona, reflecting the era’s patriarchal gender conventions. In place of a quill, she holds a flower, a symbol of fertility, positioned in such a way as to draw attention to her décolletage rather than to her intellectual capabilities. Washington recognized her talents, writing to Stockton about one of her poems, “I think the easy, simple, and beautiful strains with which the dialogue is supported, does great justice to your genius.”\n",

He sat for Stuart during the artist’s stay in New York, following a long period of portrait painting in Ireland. The resulting image, at once decorative, dignified, and virtuosic, is distinguished by the tension between its exuberant palette and the sitter’s sober pose and demeanor. Stuart’s picture is further enlivened by its characteristically soft modeling and sketchy finish, as well as by its incomplete composition, especially evident in the merely suggested quill and inkwell — the latter curiously rendered twice — and the nonexistent chair upon which the \"sitter\" would normally rest. Whether the portrait’s unfinished state is due to circumstance or, as in other works by the artist, was by design is unknown. </P></SPAN>",
