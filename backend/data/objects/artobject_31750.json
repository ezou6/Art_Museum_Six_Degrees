The wooden figures are sheathed in pieces of brass and copper—valuable materials secured through trade with Europeans—that were scoured to gleam like the surface of a body of water. In many equatorial African societies, the realm beyond the water’s surface is associated with ancestral and supernatural forces. Reliquary ensembles placed on family altars served as agents of ancestral power and were essential for the transmission of family history and genealogy. During the period of French colonial rule (1885–1960), these figures were often removed from their ensembles and separated from the human remains contained in their bases.",

The combination of an abstract, leaf-shaped face with recognizable eyes and nose above a minimalist base results in an arresting work of art. The foliate face has a slightly concave plane, below which the base extends in the shape of&nbsp;a lozenge. Lashed to an opening in the base would have been a bundle or basket of relics, consisting of the skulls of deceased family members and other sacred materials. The guardian figure protected the relics from malevolent forces and trespassing individuals. A copper wire wrapped around the face and a hammered copper strip extending down the forehead enhanced the guardian’s power, as the shiny metal could reflect and deflect unwelcome viewers. In times of community crisis, families would bring their reliquaries together, combining the reliquaries’ individual powers to entreat the ancestors for aid and protection.</P></SPAN>",
