Two years later, Sèvres Manufactory created a French version. The design of both depicts an anonymous slave on one knee, clasping his chained hands and begging the question, “Am I not a man and a brother?” Wedgwood produced many medallions, sending some to Benjamin Franklin, a former slave owner who had become a “cautious abolitionist,” for distribution to his network of connections.
