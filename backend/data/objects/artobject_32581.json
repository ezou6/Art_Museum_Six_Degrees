Vernet’s image is hardly idealized or historicizing, however. The artist shows the model’s dirty fingernails and includes the props—stacked boxes and an old, frayed pillow—used to help the young man hold his classical stance.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThis painting reflects the academic training required of students at the École des Beaux-Arts in nineteenth-century Paris. First, they learned to draw using prints and other drawings as their guides. Then, they graduated to drawing after sculpture, often using ancient works or plaster casts as models; finally, they drew or painted from live models.\n</p>",
