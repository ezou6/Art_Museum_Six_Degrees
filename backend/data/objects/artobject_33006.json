After his death, several editions in bronze were made of these works, which he had not intended for the market. <I>Schoolgirl</I> is an anomaly in the group. It is more portrait-like than the dancers and bathers, and, according to some accounts, this girl may have been a member of the Degas family. The sculpture’s genesis has been traced to one of the artist’s sketchbooks, in which he drew a young girl around 1881. This bronze cast is one of twenty made in 1955 after the original wax, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.</P></SPAN>",

Modeled in wax for private enjoyment and cast in bronze decades later, most of his sculptures are explorations of the bodies and postures of bathing women or racehorses, favorite subjects in his paintings. <em>Schoolgirl</em>, like <em>Little Dancer Aged Fourteen</em>—the artist’s only sculpture displayed in his lifetime, at the sixth Impressionist exhibition of 1881—is an outlier.",
