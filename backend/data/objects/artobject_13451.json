As is characteristic of Van Dyck’s etched plates, there is an arresting raw aesthetic to the adjoining impression of the first state. This later state reveals changes made after the publisher Gillis Hendricx acquired the <I>Iconography</I> plates in 1644: the technical imperfections were burnished away from the copper plate, some lines were darkened, and lettering was added beneath the image. Despite the more polished look that resulted, no attempt was made to complete details left unfinished by the artist, thereby preserving his original sketch. </P>\r\n</P></SPAN>",
