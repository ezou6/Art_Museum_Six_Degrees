When viewed through a binocular device called a stereoscope, the two images coalesce into one, producing an illusion of three-dimensionality. Commercially produced photographs like this one exemplify Northern whites’ demand for images of Southern Black life in the period following the Civil War. Inexpensive and popular, they catered to a variety of interests by depicting a range of subjects and genres, especially images of agricultural labor and scenes from domestic life.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Photographs like “Seben come ’leben” present racist stereotypes about Black children living in urban spaces. Here, a group of barefoot Black boys play marbles on a rundown street filled with garbage. Engrossed in the game, the children appear to be completely unaware of the photographer. However, this image is most likely not an authentic candid documentation; rather, the photographer probably instructed these children to pose, which results in the perpetuation of an image of poverty and squalor tied to the Black community. This staged image thus exemplifies the production of seemingly familiar scenes for the white audiences who consumed racially charged images as a form of entertainment—in much the same ways as they consumed minstrelsy, which had become popular in previous decades.</p><p><br></p>",
