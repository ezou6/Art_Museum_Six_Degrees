Working under the auspices of the Farm Securities Administration—the New Deal program established to ameliorate the devastating economic and social consequences of the Great Depression—Lange photographed conditions in the Dust Bowl, the southwestern region devastated by erosion and drought, which caused mass displacement as individuals and families moved west to become migrant workers. On assignment in central California, Lange was returning home when she noticed a pea-pickers camp. As Lange remembers, she initially ignored her impulse to stop at the camp and drove for miles before, “following instinct, not reason,” she turned around, a decision that resulted in this and other photographs documenting the migrants’ plight.\n</p>",
