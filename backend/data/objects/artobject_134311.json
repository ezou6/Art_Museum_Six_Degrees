            "textentryhtml":"<p>Booker Taliaferro Washington (1856–1915) was among the last generation of Black leaders born into slavery. An educator, author, orator, and advisor to several US presidents, Washington advocated for the education of Black Americans and in 1881 cofounded the Tuskegee Normal School for Colored Teachers (now Tuskegee University) in Tuskegee, Alabama. By the time of this portrait, Washington had served as the institution’s president for two decades. In this photograph, Washington’s dignified posture and confident expression are enhanced by the high-backed armchair and dramatic lighting. The way in which Washington chooses to compose himself speaks to the role of portrait photography in the construction of the self-identity of Black Americans after the Civil War. </p><p>The doubling of Washington’s image indicates that this object is a stereograph, a format that places two images taken at slightly different angles side by side on a single card. When viewed through a binocular device called a stereoscope, the two images coalesce into one, producing an illusion of three-dimensionality. Stereographs were intended for circulation and collectability, so it is likely that this portrait was widely distributed. </p><p><br></p>",
