Ruins of Richmond, April, 1865. | (FOR DESCRIPTION OF THIS VIEW SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS CARD.)\r\n\r\nPrinted on back: 6260. Ruins of Richmond, April, 1865. | When the Rebel army were forced to evacuate their Capitol at Richmond, they set fire to the city, exploded the power in their magazines and did their worst to entirely destroy the city. The Union troops came in as conquerers and immediately set to work with a will to extinguish the fires and save as much of the city as possible, but before the fires could be quenched, over 700 buildings were in ruins. This is a view of the depot of the Richmond & Petersburg Railroad. The ruined building and the ruined locomotive shows what destruction war brings. | 1861 – PHOTOGRAPHIC HISTORY – 1865 | This series of pictures are ORIGINALLY PHOTOGRAPHS taken during the war of the Rebellion. More than a quarter of a century has passed away since the sun painted these real scenes of that great war, and the \"negatives\" (made by the old \"wet plate\" process) have undergone chemical changes which renders it slow and difficult to get \"prints\" from them. Of course, no more \"negatives\" can be made, as the scenes represented by this series of war views have passed away forever. The great value of these pictures is apparent. Some \"negatives\" are entirely past printing from, and all of them are very slow printers. | A WORD AS TO PRICES. | A gentleman living near Watkin's Glen, New York, wrote us that he thought 30 cents each, too high a price for the stereoscopic war views, as he could buy views of Watkin's Glen for $1.50 per dozen. We wrote to him this effect: \"If there was but one negative of Watkin's Glen in existence, and if Watkin's Glen itself were entirely wiped off the face of the earth, and if this one negative was old and 'dense' and very slow to 'print,' and if all the people of this country were as much interested in a view of Watkin's Glen as they are in seeing the real scenes of our great war, so faithfully reproduced, THEN, and ONLY UDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, should Watkin's Glen Pictures be compared to photographs taken 'at the front' during the days of 1861 to 1865.\" | The gentleman \"acknowledged the corn,\" took the war views he wished for, paid the reasonable price asked for them, and was satisified. | The above is the only answer we shall ever make to the question of PRICE. We deem it necessary to say this much, as many persons write and us for CHEAP war views; when we change the price of these war views, it will be to double it; they will never be any cheaper than now. They can be obtained only of the undersigned or our duly authorized agents. | If you wish for a catalogue of the war views, send a stamp and your address to | Yours in F. C. and L., | The War Photograph & Exhibition Company, | Sole Owners of the Original War Views. No. 21 Linden Place, HARTFORD, CONN.",

When Confederate leaders fled the city in 1865, they set stockpiles of supplies and weapons on fire rather than allow them to fall into the hands of Union Army soldiers. The resulting blaze destroyed much of the city. This image may have been made by a white veteran named John C. Taylor, whose images the War Photograph &amp; Exhibition Company often published. It is a stereograph, a format that places two images taken at slightly different angles side by side on a single card. When viewed through a binocular device called a stereoscope, the two images coalesce into one, producing an illusion of three-dimensionality. Such stereographs, made for a Northern white audience, would have been widely distributed, demonstrating photography’s contribution to the creation of shared visual motifs and national narratives, particularly in representing the lives of Black Americans in the South after abolition and the immensity of the rebuilding efforts facing the nation in Southern cities during Reconstruction.
