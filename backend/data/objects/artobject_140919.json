            "textentryhtml":"Throughout the Middle Ages, artists created paintings depicting what was referred to as “Veronica’s veil.” The image derives from what is believed to be the blood- and sweat-soaked impression Christ’s tortured face left on the cloth with which Veronica, a woman from Jerusalem, had comforted him on his way to Calvary. The veil was venerated as an <i>acheiropoetos</i>, an image made without human hands and hence the only <i>vera icon</i>, or true image, of Christ. In this monumental woodcut, the divine apparition and its representation seem to merge as Christ’s life-size face floats on an otherwise empty sheet, as if the sheet were the veil itself. Like the mythical cloth, the woodcut is the result of a contact—the impression left by the ink-covered wooden matrix on the paper. This work is thought to be by Hans Sebald Beham, a follower of the more celebrated German artist Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528), whose monogram was added later to enhance the print’s value.\n",
