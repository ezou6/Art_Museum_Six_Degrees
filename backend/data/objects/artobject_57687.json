            "textentryhtml":"Illustrated is Liu Haichan 劉海蟾 (“Liu Sea Toad,” 10th century), a Daoist immortal. On his back is a mythical three-legged toad (chanchu 蟾蜍) and what may be strings of coins. With unkempt hair and unshod, Liu wears a tattered robe that is tied at the waist. A gourd hangs from his belt, while Liu stoops forward intent on something in his hand at his mouth. Besides inscriptions ascribed to the Song dynasty poet and artist Su Shi 蘇軾 (1037-1101) and Ming dynasty calligrapher Wang Duo 王鐸 (1592-1652), the rubbing includes a long inscription across the bottom by Zhou Mingqi. A bare patch of un-inked paper has was also reserved for the red ink seal of Fengxiang county 鳳翔縣 at top center. Zhou Mingqi also carved (or sponsored the carving of) another pictorial stone from which a rubbing in the PUAM collection was made (y1958-294). This rubbing also bears the same Fengxiang county seal. Both pictorial stones were cut and originally installed in 1906 in the Su Wenzhong Shrine 蘇文忠公祠 at East Lake in Fengxiang. After the shrine was destroyed, the pictorial stone for y1958-294 survived and is presently housed in the stele corridor at the Fengxiang Museum 鳳翔博物館 in Shaanxi province. If extant, it is possible that the Liu Haichan stone may also be in this location.",
