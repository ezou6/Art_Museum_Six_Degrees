When this sculpture\n\t\n\tentered the collections in 1940, information about its origin was unclear, especially regarding where it may have been made. In the 1990s, samples of the wood support were identified as a Cedrela species indigenous to Latin America, indicating it was likely created in the Americas and not in Spain. In 2023, further research was conducted on the sculpture’s polychrome decoration, which survives remarkably intact. Although some sculptural elements are now missing (including a knife once embedded in the top of the head as an attribute of the saint, and a hand that perhaps also once held an object), investigations performed by conservators and scientists in recent decades have provided important material evidence that informs what we now know about this sculpture’s history.\n</p>\n<p><b>\n\tElena Torok</b>, Associate Objects Conservator, Princeton University Art Museum\n</p>",

At the time of the disposal of Mr. White's art objects the statue was auctioned off to a cinema producer who apparently used it as an item of &quot;props.&quot; It was then acquired by a third owner who eventually sold it to the dealer from whom the Museum bought it.&quot;\nSee: Ernest DeWald, &quot;A Baroque Statue in Polychrome Wood,&quot; Bulletin of the Department of Art and Archaeology of Princeton University, June 1941, p. 16\n</p><p>\n </p>\n</span>",
