As Yung explains, “In those years, the phrase ‘Tian tian xiang shang’—every day we look up—was written on the wall of every primary school in China. . . . in huge characters stretching\nover the entire front wall, and it appeared quite threatening to the school-children.” Yung’s first iteration of this figure was a simply formed little boy, head facing forward, arms down. In 2007 the artist debuted the present form of the young boy, with his index finger pointing up, his head and eyes looking to the sky—shedding the impression of the figure as a passive bystander—at an exhibition in Shanghai entitled Tian tian xiang shang.\n",

He began creating little boy caricatures and drawing comics in the 1950s as a primary school student in Hong Kong. According to the artist, “In those years, the slogan ‘tian tian xiang shang’ 天天向上 (“Every day we look up”) [coined in 1951 by Mao Zedong], was written on the wall of every primary school in China…the slogan was written in huge characters stretching over the entire front wall, and it appeared quite threatening to the schoolchildren.\"</p><p><br></p><p>After developing the caricatures and comics for 33 years, Danny created a simple figure of a boy as a standing bystander or onlooker. In a 2007 Comics Exhibition in Shanghai entitled “Tian Tian Xiang Shang,” he further developed this figure into the form of a standing boy with his finger pointing up and looking skyward, echoing the deep-seated slogan. Danny called this little boy “Tian Tian,” and in subsequent exhibitions and workshops the figure was used to inspire curiosity and creativity in children. </p>",
