The emotional meeting of the brothers Jacob and Esau after a twenty-year estrangement is a good example. This paragon of fraternity illustrates a moment of healing and an instance of exemplary behavior which had required faith and trust in God to achieve. </p><p>This painting and <em>Israelites Crossing the Red Sea</em> share a history as far back as 1788, when they were in “a private contract sale” in England. Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that they were conceived as pendants. The similarities in dimension might be explained by the fact that seventeenth-century panels were produced in standard sizes. Many of Cornelis’s paintings from about 1594 share an oblong format, which was well suited to narrative works with numerous figures. The similarity in their style—smaller panels, less exaggerated musculature of the figures, and warmer, less acidic coloring—is due to their simultaneous production and broadly describes Cornelis’s later works.</p><p><em></em><br></p>",

Cornelis depicts him clasping the knee of Esau in the Greek ritual act of supplication, yet simultaneously locked in fraternal embrace, defining their complex relationship. The sons of Jacob kneel with hands raised, echoing his appeal for forgiveness. To a contemporary audience, the exotic costume and landscape would evoke a distant biblical past. Some motifs like the antique plumed helmets depend on earlier depictions, whereas others, like the hairiness of Esau relative to Jacob, seem to directly reference scripture. </p><p align=\"LEFT\" dir=\"LTR\"><em><strong>Sijbren Kramer, Class of 2024</strong></em></p></span>",
