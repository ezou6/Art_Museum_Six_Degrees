Arbus met the \"Jewish Giant\" Eddie Carmel at Hubert’s Dime Museum and Flea Circus in New York’s Times Square. Appearing in the films <I>The Brain that Wouldn’t Die </I>(1962) and <I>50,000 B.C.</I> <I>(Before Clothing)</I> (1963) and forming the rock-and-roll group Frankenstein and the Brain Surgeons, Carmel pursued a career as a performer despite his parents’ reservations. While Arbus photographed Carmel several times, this late photograph pictures him with his parents, portraying their intimate home life while also potentially <SPAN lang=EN>emphasizing the distance between them.</P></SPAN></SPAN>",

They’re aristocrats.\" She respected her subjects and spent time with them before taking their pictures. The result is a group of photographs that both ask the viewer to confront the subjects directly and define Arbus as a photographer.</P></SPAN>",
