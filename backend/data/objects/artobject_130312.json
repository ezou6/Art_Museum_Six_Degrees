This image is part of a collaboration between Parks and the novelist Ralph Ellison, whose recently published novel, <em>Invisible Man</em>, inspired Parks to produce a photo-essay re-creating scenes from the book. Published in the August 25, 1952, issue of <em>Life</em>, the project was not printed as originally conceived, as the magazine’s editors favored surreal images over documentary ones. The three-page, five-photograph feature undermined the evocative representation of the characters and themes of Ellison’s novel as well as Parks’s overall artistic vision for the project.",
