            "textentryhtml":"Made by hand (probably coiled) from a reddish, ferrous clay, with notably thin walls (~4-5 mm.), this vessel is formed in one of several standardized shapes for Wari ritual pottery; the vessel body is comprised of two hemispherical sections, from which a pair of tapering spouts emerge, to be joined by a flat bridge.  Although the vessel form could minimize evaporation, the small spouts ultimately seem impractical, and probably mark the vessel as a burial offering not actually intended to hold a liquid.  \r\n\r\nThe lower half of the vessel is slipped a consistent dark brown, while the upper half is complexly polychromed with six colors.  The composition, which repeats on each side of the vessel, features a hybrid figure with avian wings, feline head and tail, and generally humanoid proportions.  Each figure holds a staff.  One of several well-known anthropomorphized animals common in Wari art, this winged feline is traditionally considered an 'attendant' of a primary deity (not pictured on this vessel).  The winged felines are surrounded by small two-toned ovoids, which may represent beans and associate the vessel with agricultural ceremony.  The bridge presents a series of three feline heads, identical in design but of variable color.\r\n\r\nThe use of complex polychromy, as well as the basic bridge-spout design, find their origins in the Early Intermediate Period ceramics of the south-coast Nasca, yet take on distinctly geometric stylization in Wari times.  It is thought such imagery, which generally includes dominant horizontal and vertical form lines, derives from Wari textile design, especially brocading.  It is also possible that bridge-spout vessel such as this were likened to the human body: the imagery painted on the upper half could be understood to replicate a woven tunic; the roughly rectangular motifs beneath the spouts would mark the open sides of the tunic; and the small section of white cross-hatching beneath the bridge could indicate the opening for the head\r\n",
