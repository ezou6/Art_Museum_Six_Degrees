            "textentryhtml":"These carvings of swimming birds are pieces for a children&#8217;s game of &#8220;dice&#8221; that was played all across the Arctic. Bird figures found in archaeological sites show that the game spread across northern Alaska, Canada, and Greenland about 1,000 years ago, carried by migrating Thule ancestors of the modern Eskimo/Inuit. In play, some birds land upright when tossed on the ground, while others tip over on their sides. In central Canada, where this ancient game is called <i>tingmiujaq</i>, players keep the birds that land upright, and whoever collects the most after several rounds is the winner. Sometimes, players can pick up only the birds whose heads point in their direction. Carvings almost identical to these pieces have been made as market art for the past 100 years.",
