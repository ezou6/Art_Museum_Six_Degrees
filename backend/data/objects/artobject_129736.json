When viewed through a binocular device called a stereoscope, the two images coalesce into one, producing an illusion of three-dimensionality. Commercially produced photographs like this one exemplify Northern whites’ demand for images of Southern Black life in the period following the Civil War. Inexpensive and popular, they catered to a variety of interests by depicting a range of subjects and genres, especially images of agricultural labor and scenes from domestic life.&nbsp; </p><p><em>Trouble Ahead</em> exemplifies the postbellum production of highly staged, stereotypical images for a mass audience. This photograph presents a Black mother cooking while one child sleeps in a wheelbarrow and the other scratches a drawing of his “MAMY” on the wallpaper. This genre scene suggests a narrative in which the proximity of the rolling pin and the broom leaning over the kitchen counter foreshadow a dramatic and violent reprisal. In fact, this work, inscribed “12324—(a) Trouble Ahead,” is actually the first in a two-part series. The next photograph, inscribed “12325— (b) Trouble Behind,” not in the Museum’s collection, shows the mother using her flour-covered hand to spank her child, whose face is contorted into a howl. </p><p><br></p>",
