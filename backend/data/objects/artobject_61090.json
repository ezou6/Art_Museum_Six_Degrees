In the past, if a twin died, a figure (<em>Ère Ìbejì</em>) was carved to contain its spirit. Cared for as if a living child, the figure was fed, bathed, and washed by its mother, her constant touching blurring its facial features over time. Necklaces of shiny red Abrus seeds further beautify these figures, and may allude to the plant’s medicinal uses; the toxic seeds, however, are deadly when ingested. The elaborate beaded tunic suggests these twins’ royal origins.",

The loss of one twin might destabilize or cause the death of the other. If one twin dies, a figure is carved as a conceptual replacement to encourage the survivor. These <i>ère ìbejì</i>, named for the <i>òrìṣà</i>, or god, Ìbejì, are bedecked with expensive beads as a mark of honor and care. Such regalia derives from the principle that duality is derivative of balance, stability, and survival. The red, gold, and white beads of the tunic are reminiscent of Ṣàngó, the Yorùbá god of thunder, lightning, and electricity. The white is the insignia of Obatala, the creator god. Attention is paid to large eyes as ocular frames of vision. The red <i>tukula </i>pigment, typically used as rouge to beautify brides, emphasizes the care bestowed on twins as delicate vessels.\n</p>\n<p><b>\n\tDele Layiwola</b>, Professor and Director of African Studies, University of Ibadan, Nigeria\n</p>",
