Hamilton’s early work is indelibly associated with Pop art, a term introduced by his colleague Lawrence Alloway in 1958. As with other Pop artists, Hamilton utilized readymade images pilfered from mass media. The work here stems from a snapshot he took while watching a TV news report on the May 4, 1970, shooting of nine students at Kent State University by members of the National Guard. Hamilton translated the photograph into a haunting screenprint whose 5,000 impressions ensured its wide distribution. Ringed by a black border—a remnant of the television screen from which it was taken—this contemporary pietà asserts its identity as a televisual image, emphasizing the role TV had recently begun to play in the framing of public experience.",
