Following the artist’s first solo exhibition in London, in 1962, Riley’s optically aggressive paintings came to epitomize the international style critics labeled Op Art. With its sharpedged clarity and flat color areas, the silkscreen process had been used primarily for commercial advertising purposes, but in the 1960s the medium became a favorite printmaking technique for British and American artists.",

Riley embraced screenprinting for its ability to render precise geometries and flat, even surfaces, although at the time the technique was widely considered a commercial rather than an art process. For this composition, she used a stencil to achieve the sharp edges and striking black-and-white contrast, which create an aggressive optical effect that makes the image appear as if it is spinning and vibrating. Riley’s black-and-white works epitomize Op art’s use of formal elements to affect the viewer’s perception of space. She has described such works as \"events\" that are designed to draw attention to \"the explosive facts of actually looking.\"  </p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\" dir=\"LTR\"></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\" dir=\"LTR\">　</p></span>",
