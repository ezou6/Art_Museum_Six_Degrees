The subject of this work derives from a legend, recorded by Pliny the Elder, of the Corinthian maiden Dibutade, who traced her sleeping lover’s shadow on the wall before his departure on a long journey—thereby creating an image to remember him by during his absence. This story, which was associated with the origins of the art of painting, became a popular theme with Romantic artists, particularly in England. Here, Romney created a lamplit nocturnal scene with the figures shown in strong profile in a manner reminiscent of Greek vase-painting and low-relief sculpture.",
