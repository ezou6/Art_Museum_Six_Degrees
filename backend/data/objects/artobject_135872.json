The people were given land on the Battle River near Fort Battleford. During this time of resettlement, the Plains Cree were living on reserves, in small log houses. They were given rations by the Indian Agent. These rations were meager and often had bugs in the dry goods or near-rotten meat, consisting mostly of organs and intestines. The water source was a small river that ran through the reserve. Because of the contaminated conditions, outbreaks of typhoid fever were common during the summer months when people gathered for the Sun Dance and other ceremonies. The people were denied medical help, as the Indian Agent was the only one to allow access to the reserve. Indigenous people at this time were heavily regulated by the government.\n</p>\n<p><b>\n\tRuth Cuthand\n</b></p>",
