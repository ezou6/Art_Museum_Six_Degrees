While situating Jerome and his faithful companion in an outdoor setting, Van Leyden emphasized Jerome’s studious character by showing him reading a book and clothed in voluminous robes; the cardinal’s hat alludes to Jerome’s role as advisor to one of the popes. A generation younger than Albrecht Dürer, Van Leyden was the first Dutch printmaker to establish an international reputation through his engravings and woodcuts. Dürer’s influence is seen in the artist’s refined textures, panoramic landscape views, and keen attention to natural details. </P></SPAN>",
