Over seven hundred pieces of mostly clear glass were used in the production of&nbsp; each of the Martin House’s more than sixty \"Tree of Life\" windows, which formed a key part of the complex’s sixteen distinct patterns of art glass and collectively helped to comprise one of Wright’s most sophisticated and elaborate architectural ensembles. </P></SPAN>",
