In two iconic portraits, Charles Willson Peale presents two views of George Washington at one of the most important battles of the American Revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p>“George Washington after the Battle of Princeton” seen here is one of at least a dozen replicas that Peale&nbsp; painted depicting Washington at ease during the aftermath of the conflict, with victory assured. The other view, which resides at the Art Museum, “George Washington at the Battle of Princeton”(1784), evokes the battle itself (one that Peale experienced firsthand as an officer of the Philadelphia militia) and makes specific reference to events from it, notably the death of Washington’s friend General Hugh Mercer, shown expiring in the arms of surgeon Benjamin Rush. Perhaps on account of its greater specificity, this rendition of the battle, was perfectly suited for its intended destination in Nassau Hall, was not repeated by Peale, and unlike the version seen here, is unique. The Museum portrait, completed in 1784, on commission from the trustees of the College of New Jersey, and installed for more than two centuries in Nassau Hall, was apparently paid for with funds bestowed by Washington himself as a testimony of his regard for the institution, regarding which he wrote, “No college has turned out better scholars or more estimable characters than Nassau.”</p>",
