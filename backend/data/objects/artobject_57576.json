            "textentryhtml":"Guanyin as the Nine-lotus bodhisattva is seated behind a balustrade with the character “Buddha” (fo 佛) in her headdress. On her right on top of a balustrade corner post is set a kundika ritual ewer with a willow spray. In front is a pond with nine lotus blossoms and the small figures of the boy pilgrim Shancai 善財童子 (Sanscrit: Sudhana) standing on a lotus leaf at right, and the Dragon Girl (龍女) at left. Behind Guanyin is a fantastic garden rock in a bamboo grove with a parrot at upper right. At upper left is the figure of a guardian warrior standing on a cloud swirl. In 1586, nine lotus flowers issued as double blooms in the palace residence of the Empress Dowager Cisheng 慈聖 (Xiaoding taihou 孝定太后,&nbsp; Li Caifeng 李彩鳳, 1546-1614), who was a devout Buddhist. In a dream visitation, she was bestowed the text of the Nine Lotus Sutra (Jiulian jing 九蓮經). Viewed as omens, these occurrences led Cisheng to see herself as the incarnation of Guanyin. The carved inscription at upper left dates when the pictorial stone from which this rubbing was taken was erected, but the identity of the carver or carving agent is obscured by efforts to change or efface the name.",
