            "textentryhtml":"Jonson Van Ceulen, an artist of Flemish-German descent born in London, found success as a portraitist to English aristocracy before moving to The Netherlands in 1643. The fashionable woman in this portrait wears a <em>tipmuts</em>, a flat black cap that covers the crown of her head with an attached “ball” of the same material for her hair. Under the cap, she wears a metal<em> oorijzer</em>, a clamp placed around the head to keep the cap in place. Her only jewelry, pendant pearl earrings, are attached to the bottom of the <em>oorijzer</em>. The rich black garment, worn over a white satin gown with broad bands of bobbin lace edging the neckline, belonged to the artist rather than the lady; it appears in various of Jonson’s other portraits of women dating from 1649 to 1658. The artist likely painted their faces from life but their clothes from drapery in the studio, perhaps with the help of an assistant. He probably painted her hands from a study he drew from life in chalks on blue paper, a technique he might have learned from Van Dyck in London. The thinly painted blue background, unusual in Dutch portraiture, is probably made from indigo mixed with lead white. It has become more transparent with time, allowing the broadly brushed brown layer underneath to become more visible.<br>",

            "textentryhtml":"\nCornelis Jonson van Ceulen, who began his career as a portraitist in London, was trained in England and in the Netherlands. He would have been aware of Sir Anthony Van Dyck’s portraits of Charles I and his court, painted in the elegant, grand-manner &shy;conventions that Van Dyck brought from Italy; his own work, for a wealthy clientele but not the highest aristocracy, was conservative and followed English and Netherlandish traditions. During the civil war, commissions vanished, and Jonson moved to the Netherlands in 1643, settling first in Middelburg, then in Amsterdam and, finally, briefly in Utrecht.<p></p>\nAfter the execution of Charles I, members of the Stuart family and supporters flowed into Europe, bringing their taste for the Van Dyck style. Jonson, too, adopted this more elevated manner of portraiture for his sitters, practicing a painterly style with visible brushstrokes and elegant compositions. His most accomplished portraits date from the 1650s, when this portrait of a woman was painted. Her severe black dress is relieved by the white collar and cuffs, and Jonson’s preferred blue background. The few touches of luxury fade in importance before her steady gaze and gracefully clasped hands. This was the aim of the Calvinist prescription for black dress: to subordinate worldly goods to a place of less importance than more lasting spiritual concerns. <p></p><em>Handbook of the Collections, 2013</em>",
