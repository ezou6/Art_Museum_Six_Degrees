Dine was long fascinated with everyday objects—paint cans and brushes, household tools, pieces of wood—which he sometimes physically incorporated into his paintings. From the early 1960s he was associated with the Pop Art movement and with artists such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. His work featured alongside theirs in the influential 1962 exhibition <em>New Painting of Common Objects</em>. Dine became one of the most inventive and prolific printmakers of the period, whose prints number over 1,000 works.",
