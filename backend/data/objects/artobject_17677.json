In these two photomontages, Wojnarowicz printed negative images of powerful natural and man-made forces—here a bridge and a tornado—and overlaid them with text from newspapers or his own poetry. He then superimposed circular peepholes that afford glimpses of scenes such as pornographic vignettes and microscopic blood cells. In the work on the left, Wojnarowicz revealed the inequity of treatment being provided, noting: “Word is out that many poor minorities are unable to get a diagnosis of AIDS from clinical doctors because if given a diagnosis then hospital beds have to be made available to them in the event of a severe illness as P.C.P. pneumonia.”",

In this group of photomontages, Wojnarowicz printed negative images of powerful natural and man-made forces, here a tornado and a bridge, and overlaid them with text from newspapers or his own poetry and superimposed circular peepholes that afford glimpses of intimate scenes, such as pornographic vignettes and microscopic blood cells. <I>The Sex Series </I>documents how dominant American culture marginalized homosexuality and the devastation wrought by AIDS, from which the artist succumbed in 1992. Yet in expressing the anxieties that permeated the gay community and making them both personal and universal, Wojnarowicz ensured that his own experiences would not be erased from cultural memory.</P></SPAN>",
