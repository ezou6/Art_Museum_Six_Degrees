Muybridge was the first to successfully document and analyze the motion of animals and humans by taking multiple photographs in rapid succession and displaying them side by side. These series answered many questions about motion that had eluded the human eye, the most famous of which was whether all of a running horse’s legs leave the ground simultaneously. Perhaps more significantly, these images, projected one after the other, became one of the first iterations of motion pictures. In <I>Leaping Men</I>, Muybridge created a study of motion through a physical interaction between two men, capturing the musculature of the human form and locomotion over time. </P></SPAN>",
