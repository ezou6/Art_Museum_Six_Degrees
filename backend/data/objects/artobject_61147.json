            "textentryhtml":"\r\nAn influential second-generation feminist artist, Hannah Wilke produced sculptures and performances that probed the relationship between aesthetics, eroti&shy;cism, and politics. She began her career as a sculptor, utilizing both conventional and unorthodox materials, from ceramic and porcelain to bubble gum, pencil erasers, Play-Doh, laundry lint, and cookie dough. Her sculptures evoke both the body and the natural world, as seen in <I>Untitled</I>, whose delicate folds recall seed pods, shells, and flowers, as well as female genitalia, a&nbsp;symbol of female empowerment commonly employed by feminists. Such works also speak to&nbsp;contemporaneous developments in sculpture, particularly process-based, post-Minimalist sculpture, christened by the critic Lucy Lippard as \"eccentric abstraction.\"</P>\r\n<I>S.O.S. Starification Object Series</I> represents one of Wilke’s earliest experiments with performance. A deeply ambiguous work, it embraces sensuality at the same time that it mocks male desire and satirizes gender stereotypes. Wilke’s pose recalls that of a pin-up. The aura of impeccable glamour she projects, however, is disrupted by the pieces of gum — chewed and kneaded to resemble vulvas — that mar her otherwise flawless back. According to the artist, these \"wounds\" symbolized women’s second-class status, their &shy;\"disposability.\" They might also allude to Christian stigmata or the scarification rituals of tribal cultures. The work’s title is rife with contradictions: it blurs the distinction between \"stars\" and \"scars,\" suggesting that glamour is inextricable from injury and female beauty from distress. </P></SPAN>",

Wilke began her career as a sculptor, creating pieces in clay and terracotta that evoke both organic forms and female genitalia, a symbol of women’s empowerment in the 1970s. In 1974, Wilke began experimenting with performance art. One of her fi rst forays into this genre was <EM>S.O.S. Starification Object Series</EM>. As seen in the photographic documentation displayed here, Wilke mimics an iconic pin-up pose, tempting the viewer’s voyeuristic gaze. The aura of impeccable glamour she projects is disrupted by the pieces of gum—chewed and kneaded to resemble vulvas—that mar her otherwise fl awless back. According to the artist, the gum symbolized women’s second-class status, their “disposability.”",
