When viewed through a binocular device called a stereoscope, the two images coalesce into one, producing an illusion of three-dimensionality. Commercially produced photographs like this one exemplify Northern whites’ demand for images of Southern Black life in the period following the Civil War. Inexpensive and popular, they catered to a variety of interests by depicting a range of subjects and genres, especially images of agricultural labor and scenes from domestic life.&nbsp; </p><p>During the postbellum era, white audiences were especially interested in scenes of Black domestic life, motivating photographers to stage intimate moments for widespread consumption. Here, the photographer gathered a family on the porch of their home. The family is shown with solemn facial expressions and wearing tattered clothing. The depiction of their hardship perpetuates visual motifs, including ragged garments and modest dwellings, that were used to depict enslaved Black people in the preceding decades. Such images served to satisfy white audiences’ interest in liberated Black Americans while holding on to stereotypical notions of Black people as inevitably impoverished. </p><p><br></p>",

Clearly staging his subjects, the anonymous photographer created images that imagine Black freedom through visual motifs similar to those used to depict enslaved people. These prints are chillingly reminiscent of life before emancipation, with<em> Family on porch, mother breastfeeding</em> and <em>Negro Cabin</em> both similar to photographs of plantation life, glossing over the raw reality of hardship etched in the subjects’ solemn faces and tattered clothing. Meanwhile, <em>Stereograph of Composition of 224</em> depicts African American sharecroppers picking cotton. Sharecropping kept Black families indebted for generations to white landowning families. It was a precarious economic existence, exacerbated by high interest rates, unpredictable harvests, and harsh working conditions. Despite promises of change, in these photographs progress appears to be a distant dream.</p><p><br><strong><em>Natalie Bahrami, Class of 2021</em></strong></p>",
