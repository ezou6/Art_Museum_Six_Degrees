Using the software program Adobe Illustrator and vector graphics, which employ a series of mathematical commands to generate images, McCollum created a system that could produce nearly thirtyone billion unique abstract shapes. An exercise in numerical incomprehensibility, the project has the potential to result in more individual shapes than the nearly eleven billion people that are estimated to make up the world’s peak population around the year 2100.",

An exercise in absurdity, <I>The Shapes Project</I> will result in as many shapes as there will be people in the middle of the twenty-first century. Using Adobe Illustrator, the artist has thus far created 214,000,000 shapes, each one unique; the production of some shapes he has outsourced to other individuals. In addition to monoprints, sculptures, and wall reliefs, they have been translated into non-art formats, including gifts, awards, emblems, toys, and souvenirs. McCollum first rose to prominence in the late 1970s as a member of the Pictures Generation, a diverse group of artists who questioned notions of rarity, authorship, and originality, the criteria against which value in the art world is determined. </P></SPAN>",
