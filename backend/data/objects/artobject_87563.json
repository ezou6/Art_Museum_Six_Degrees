            "textentryhtml":"Shortly after Oscar Wilde’s <em>Salome</em> was first published in 1891, the illustrator Aubrey Beardsley was asked by the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> to respond to the play with a drawing. Although the newspaper rejected Beardsley’s macabre rendition of the play’s final scene, his illustration was published in an issue of <em>Studio</em> magazine later that year. When Wilde saw Beardsley’s work, he inscribed a copy of <em>Salome</em> “for Aubrey,” calling him “the only artist” who could see the eponymous princess’s “invisible dance” of the seven veils, a performance said to have led to the execution of John the Baptist. Beardsley illustrated in full the 1894 edition of Wilde’s play, for which this cover design was created. The&nbsp; scrawled title echoes Wilde’s delighted description of Beardsley’s drawings as “the naughty scribbles a precocious schoolboy makes on the margins of his copybooks,” while the stylized peacock feathers function like a theater curtain, creating a sense of anticipation for the reader.",
