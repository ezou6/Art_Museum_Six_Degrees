The four men depicted on this example can be identified as Portuguese by their short beards, helmets, and clothing. Trade between West African kingdoms and the Portuguese began in the late fifteenth century. Portuguese traders were portrayed to symbolize economic and political power and were associated with the god Olókun, who crosses the water to bring wealth. The Edo royal brass-casting guilds dramatically increased their production after the fifteenth century due to the influx of brass <i>manillas </i>(bracelet-shaped metal currency) imported by the Portuguese. In 1897, British troops invaded the capital of Benin Kingdom to bring inland\n\nNigeria, its commodities, and its trade routes under British colonial control. Many Benin objects came to an international market in the years following the looting that accompanied this attack. Research is underway to determine the origins of the four objects from Benin Kingdom in Princeton’s collection, including this bracelet.\n",

This is because the only memory my mother had of foreigners in Benin was of the British expedition in 1897.\n\nIt is surprising to me how this long and very important part of the history\n\nof the Benin Kingdom has been erased in my mother’s memory by that\n\none event, as though that history did not exist in her young years. Although\n\nto erase would mean it was once present. So was it? I will not speculate further, but we know that it is always easier to destroy than to build.\n</p><p><b>\nTaiye Idahor</b>, artist, Lagos, Nigeria\n</p>",

A male figure representing a Portuguese navigator alternates with the figure of a noblemen on horseback, each one appearing twice. The equestrian may represent the divine king, who alone may own horses. The man is one of many portrayed in Edo court arts after Portuguese traders began traveling to Benin City in the late fifteenth century. Edo peoples drew parallels between the Portuguese sailors and the god Olokun, who crosses water and brings wealth to the living. The openwork lattice pattern, elaborate surfaces, and dynamic use of space attest to the artistry of the royal brass-&shy;casting guilds. Similar bracelets, carved in ivory, are reserved for the king. </P></SPAN>",
