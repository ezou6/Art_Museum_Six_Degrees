Like many of his colleagues, his practice was highly self-reflexive, and it placed a premium on art that addressed the activities of making and looking at art. In addition to a drawing, <I>Blind Time L</I> is also a record of its own making insofar as it documents and acknowledges the act that brought it into being. This act is itself of a very specific type: instead of an exercise in virtuosity or an outburst of creative imagination, it consists of a straightforward task determined beforehand and executed in a rather perfunctory manner. These sorts of acts, sometimes referred to as task-based performances, proliferated in the 1960s and 1970s, their goal being to hinder both expression and deliberation. Morris raised the stakes by executing his <I>Blind Time</I> drawings with his eyes closed, thereby opening the door to chance. </P></SPAN>",

These sorts of acts, sometimes referred to as task-based performances, proliferated in the 1960s and ’70s, as ways of separating both expression and deliberation from the act of creation, making each work’s composition the result of a predetermined formula and shifting its emphasis from its final form to an exposition of its process. A prolific and influential artist, Morris was a pioneer of this practice; by executing his <I>Blind Time </I>drawings with his eyes closed, he introduced the element of chance and further distanced his control as the artist of the final composition. </P></SPAN>",
