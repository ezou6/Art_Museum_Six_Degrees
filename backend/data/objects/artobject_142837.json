On a Dogon individual’s passing, their life was celebrated with speeches commemorating their accomplishments and through the commissioning of a memorial\n\n\tsculpture, like this one. Such portrait sculptures were placed on family altars to recognize and preserve the legacies of the individuals they\n\n\trepresent. This figure represents a woman, probably of child-bearing years, with a carved braided hairstyle, full breasts, and elongated torso and limbs. For centuries, Dogon communities have lived on the Bandiagara Plateau in Mali, where they have a long history of trade and interaction with different cultures in the region. Due to the dry climate, centuries-old Dogon wood sculptures similar to this one have been\n\n\tpreserved, making precise dating difficult.\n</p>",
