The blurred presence of three naked children against the clothed adult figure’s grounded solidity, along with the woman’s upturned and affectionate gaze, gives the work narrative qualities typical of Berridge’s work, which often focuses on individuals finding meaning under difficult circumstances. Such strategies also allow the relationship between adult and children to be intentionally ambiguous, just as the fates awaiting the figures—are the children to be read as spectral presences?—remain unclear.",
