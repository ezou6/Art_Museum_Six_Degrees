Wright grew up in the Jackson-Witherspoon community of Princeton and attended the Witherspoon Street School for Colored Children and Princeton High School. His uncle was a steward at the Key and Seal Club; his father, a cook for Dr. Robert Wicks, former dean of the Princeton Chapel. His mother and aunts were domestics in the homes of prominent Princetonians. An amateur photographer, Wright had an eye for the abstract. He said he was first attracted to the vibrant colors of Luvwezo’s piece but saw so much more. He remembered meeting Luvwezo on or near campus selling his work, and he immediately offered to buy it. Wright built the frame, and the painting found a home above the fireplace in the Dempsey Avenue house he shared with his wife and two sons.</p>\n<p>\n\tRobert Wright and Allison Davis, family of Robert Weldon Wright\n</p>",
