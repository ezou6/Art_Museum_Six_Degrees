He was calling it the “knight’s move”? You’re going towards something, and then at the last minute you swerve to the side. Towards the bridge with no center. Um . . . yeah. It reminds me not to work it out, like not choreograph it per se. All those things kind of sync, so that the decisions you make in the moment are authentic. That’s the word I was looking for: authentic. It’s like, that’s the goal and it’s a really, really hard job.

Not even, you know, is that right? Not even, you know? But just to . . .a romance with it? Uhh . . . Ahh. And then! Anyway.
