            "textentryhtml":"In 1916, while living in Zurich, Arp began experimenting with cut wood reliefs that fused two significant innovations of twentieth-century art: collage and abstraction. Although the shapes and compositions he developed were nonreferential, Arp considered them part of an “object language” inspired by nature and everyday life. With Shirtfront and Necktie, he rendered banal objects into stylized and abstract tableaux. The work demonstrates how, after moving to Paris in the 1920s, Arp absorbed key ambitions of the art movements centered in the city. He adapted the Dadaists’ preoccupation with recontextualizing or reclassifying everyday objects and the Surrealists’ interest in collage and the juxtaposition of disparate forms.",

In 1916, while living in Zurich, Arp participated in Dada-related activities at the Cabaret Voltaire. While living in Paris in the 1920s, he came under the sway of the Surrealists, and his work was included in the first group exhibition of Surrealist art at the Galerie Pierre, in Paris, in 1925. </P>\r\nArp was one of the first artists to embrace two of the avant-garde’s most important inventions: collage and abstraction. In 1916–17, he began to produce painted relief sculptures, using mostly wood and, slightly later, cardboard. <I>Shirtfront and Necktie</I> is one such work. Emphatically organic, it references an everyday object — clothing — which Arp has made strange and unfamiliar, imbuing the inhuman with a kind of animus. This particular assemblage was inspired by Arp’s study of the Neolithic wall carvings at Locmariaquer, in Brittany, the subject of a book published in France in 1927. Its composition echoes one carving in particular, from a section of the ruins called the \"covered bent path of the flat rocks.\" </P></SPAN>",
