When Ying Qi started serving as prefect [of Huangzhou] in 1867, there was a Bamboo and Clog Pavilion (Liji Ting 笠屐亭). Song Luo had painted the portrait there and copied it to the pavilion, but the pavilion was destroyed by troops in the Xianfeng reign (1851-1861) and the painting tragically was not recovered. Wei Juchuan 魏巨川 from Xiaochang 孝昌 and Ying Qi had the same hopes, and in 1877 [Wei?] got a rubbing from a friend in travels to Yuzhang 豫章, and brought it back to show Ying. It had a colophon by Liu Yong, but several characters were murky, and what was said to be “examined” (guancha 觀察 [2 characters at the damaged beginning of Liu Yong’s colophon]) can no longer be discerned, but thankfully the image was complete and in one piece. But this image was different from what Song Luo had copied. In Song Luo’s, [Su Shi] is hopping on one leg in mud, his waist and feet are more robust, and is walking to his left while looking to his right, expecting the laughing onlookers and barking of dogs . . . The vigorous spirit and lifelike understanding are embodied in Song Luo’s painting. Wei’s rubbing had put Liu Yong’s colophon on the left and the portrait was in its old place. “I record these affairs, then put together the calligraphy and composed a poem . . . On the 16th day of the 2nd month of autumn in the 3rd year of the Guangxu reign, respectfully recorded by Ying Qi from Shenyang.”",
