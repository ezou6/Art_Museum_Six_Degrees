            "textentryhtml":"<p>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was clinically reported in the United States, although not yet named, in 1981. Until the advent of antiviral drugs in the mid-1990s, no effective treatments existed. The epidemic first aggressively infiltrated marginalized populations such as the queer community and intravenous drug users, creating a stigma that exacerbated the trauma to patients and their loved ones. David Wojnarowicz used his art to confront these and other related social-justice issues. In 1986 the cartoonist James Romberger began working with Wojnarowicz on a graphic memoir of the latter’s life, from his years as a homeless teenager to his struggles with AIDS. Romberger continued to work on the project after Wojnarowicz’s death, publishing <em>7 Miles a Second</em> in 1996. This screenprint of one of the layouts merges the format of the graphic novel with an illness narrative, conveying failure, loss, and moving expressions of love.</p><p><strong>Student response:</strong></p><span lang=\"EN\"></span><p align=\"LEFT\" dir=\"LTR\"><font face=\"Calibri\">In the midst of a global pandemic and at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, I, like David Wojnarowicz, am angry. As a young gay person from the Midwest, I have been denied any sort of \"positive\" queer cultural inheritance. In fact, the queerness I have inherited has been molded significantly by the AIDS crisis. In the gay community, I have observed sexual anxiety and a desire for assimilation</font>,<font face=\"Calibri\"> as well as white supremacy and a still</font>-<font face=\"Calibri\">prevalent disgust toward HIV</font>-<font face=\"Calibri\">positive people. These all linger as effects of the rigorously regressive moral politics of the 1980s and ’90s. In the 1980s, a time where sexual liberation was at its height, the appearance of \"Gay-Related Immune Deficiency\" lent right-wing politicians an excuse to erroneously link homosexuality to immorality. My generation (along with, of course, our elders) is still working to erase those pernicious residues. </font></p><p><font face=\"Calibri\">\n<p align=\"LEFT\" dir=\"LTR\"> </p><p>\n<font face=\"Calibri\">Although I would love to read this piece as beautifully intimate, an eternally apolitical cry for <i>more time</i> in the arms of a dying lover, I don’t think it would be what David Wojnarowicz, the activist who is my namesake, would have wanted. The violence he represents in this scene reminds me not only of the atrophy of the AIDS</font>-<font face=\"Calibri\">ravaged body, but also of the destruction of the queer subject by the administrations and institutions who, during this crisis, would rather we had died than be accepted. </font></p></font></p><p><font face=\"Calibri\">\n<p align=\"LEFT\" dir=\"LTR\"> </p><p>\nNow, still feeling the repercussions of our denial to life (BIPOC and trans people most prominently), my generation has been tasked with making up for lost time. </p><p>\n<font face=\"Calibri\">David Timm ’22<p><br></p></font></p></font></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
