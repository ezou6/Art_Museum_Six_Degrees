To make the works in the series, the artist writes the Persian word eshgh, which translates to “love” or “passion,” repeatedly across a foot-long strip of paper in a calligraphic script that she devised herself. She then paints the top edge of each strip with a color, stacking the strips into groups according to color, and tightly rolls the colored strips of paper together to build, blend, and mix colors within each coiled cylinder. Shafie describes these scrolls as ketabs, the Persian word for book. Each composition is like a hidden manuscript and an act of meditation, recalling the repeated chants and spiraling motions of Sufi spiritual practice.",
