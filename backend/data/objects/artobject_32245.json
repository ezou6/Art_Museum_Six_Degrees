Approached by&nbsp;the sitter’s husband, noted collector Henry G. Marquand, the artist quoted a discouragingly large fee, which when accepted left him no recourse but to embark on what turned out to be a highly productive phase of his career, largely due to the success of this picture. Widely admired for its restrained character — reassuringly unlike the artist’s scandalously risqué <EM>Mme Gautreau (Madame X)</EM> of 1885 — the Marquand portrait engendered numerous American commissions and was regarded by Sargent as \"a turning point in [his] fortunes.\" Here, he suppresses the conspicuously virtuosic brushwork that made him the most fashionable portraitist in England and the United States, while retaining vestiges of the immediacy it affords. Mrs. Marquand is shown conservatively attired in a dark antique dress, seated in a chair of similarly aged design, in a composition that reflects the emerging appeal of the Colonial Revival while also implying the subject’s chaste character.</P></SPAN>",

When Sargent came from London to Newport, Rhode Island, to paint Mrs. Marquand, it was only his second visit to the United States. The portrait was admired for its fluent execution and restrained character, leading the author Henry James to remark, “Mrs. M. will do him great good with the public—they will want to be painted like that—respectfully, honourably, <i>dignement</i>.” The Marquand portrait led to numerous American commissions and was regarded by Sargent as a turning point in his career. Passed down through the Marquand family, it hung above the reference desk in Princeton’s Marquand Library until the sitter’s granddaughter donated it to the Museum in 1977.\n",
