In addition to exploiting enslaved black people for physical and sexual labor, white people also used black bodies as subjects for scientific research, often capturing them nude for detailed inspection, as seen <A href=\"55920\">here</A>. Through the medium of the self-portrait, contemporary American artist Carla Williams contends with the objectifying nature of these photographs by assuming responsibility for her own bodily observation. Like the scientific black subjects, Williams stands nude. However, she stands with her knees bent, legs slightly apart, eyes closed, head tilted back, and hands tightly clenched on her stomach. In doing so, she resists the invasive scientific images of black subjects who were forced to stand fully erect with their bodies and eyes directed at the camera. </P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Matthew Choi Taitano<BR>Princeton Class of 2018</STRONG></P>",

This technique allows Williams to display herself nude in a way that combats the objectification and hypersexualization of the black female body in the West. The top of Williams’s breasts, specifically her nipples, is covered by shadows, as is her vulva, which appears as a black hole. By obscuring these parts of the female body, Williams is able to present herself nude without being consumed as a sexual object. The glossiness of the paper also has the potential to obscure the piece when light is cast on it, depending on the position of the viewer and the lighting in which it is viewed. This effect forces us to reposition ourselves so that we can fully and actively engage with the portrait. In the process, we consider how we “see” Williams’s body under light, which is often associated with whiteness. In other words, the way in which light, which acts as a metaphor for whiteness and the Western gaze, obscures the photograph due to its glossy texture is a means through which Williams’s work further resists Western traditions and perceptions that objectify and exploit the black female body.</P>\r\n<P><STRONG>Matthew Choi Taitano<BR>Princeton Class of 2018</STRONG><BR>(prepared for the course AAS 349 / ART 364, Seeing to Remember: Representing Slavery Across the Black Atlantic, Spring 2017)</P>",
