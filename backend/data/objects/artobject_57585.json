Chen Yuansu 陳元素 (16th-early 17th century). For his biog., see Mingren zhuanji ziliao suoyin 明人傳記資料索引 (1978), p. 575. \r\nSummary:\r\nThe Shen’s were a prominent family in Xiangcheng 相城, Changzhou 長洲. [The grandfather] was the Confucianist Shen Mengyuan 沈氏孟淵. In the Yongle period (1403-1424), he was recommended but did not serve in office and spent his life as a recluse. He had a good eye and lived carefree in a gardened estate entertaining guests, and he “only feared if nobody came.” In courage he was compared to Gu Zhongying 顧仲瑛 [Yuan dynasty]. He had two sons, Shen Nanzhai 沈南齋 (Shen Zhenzhai 貞吉) and Shen Tongzhai 沈同齋 (Shen Hengji 恒吉), who were good at poetry and the brush and literary arts. They did not sell their works for money. Literary gifts were mutually exchanged between the family members. Shen Nanzhi’s son was Shen Zhou (zi: Qinan 啟南, hao: Shitian 石田, Baishiweng 白\r\n石翁), who was known by everyone in the Wu region. His ink works were in great demand and his painting was divine. Even if Dong Yuan 董源 (act. 937-76), Juran 巨然 (act. 10th century), and Xu Xi 徐熙 (late 9th-before 975) and his sons returned, they could not surpass Shen Zhou. His calligraphy was in the manner of Huang Tingjian 黃庭堅 (1045-1105), and in his poetry Bai Juyi 白居易 (772-846). “Whatever thought entered his mind; he would pursue it relentlessly without rest. He was widely learned and there was nothing he did not know.” \r\n\tHe wrote many books, but he also had ability in statecraft, but did not use it. He was also pure and honest. Since youth he was gifted and could write just by lifting his brush. He did not want to study for a government career and focused on studying while also farming. In good times, there was wine for friends and leisurely conversation and he brought out from storage old paintings, calligraphy, and objects, which they enjoyed together. In his late years his reputation grew and he was visited by many; he captured an age. \r\n“On the longest day [June 20/21] in the first year of the Taichang reign, recorded by the houxue official Chen Yuansu.”\r\nRubbing seal:\r\n“Yuansu” 元素, rect. relief\r\n",

To the left is an 1562 colophon by the painter Wen Jia 文嘉 (1501-1583) that cites Shen Zhou’s comments on his own appearance. The portrait follows a freehand painted copy that possibly belonged Chen Xing 陳省 (1529-1612), onto which Wen Jia added his ink inscription. Further left is a long colophon in two-parts written by Chen Yuansu 陳元素 (16th-early 17th century) in 1620. The carved stone from which this rubbing was taken was carved after a Ming album currently in the Jinmotang Collection 近墨堂 in Hong Kong. In the album, Wen Jia’s colophon appears at upper right above the portrait. The Chen Yuansu appears on a separate album leaf and has a small gap at the center, which was exaggerated and made much wider in the carved stone and rubbing. Many of the seals were also repositioned on the carving, and the number of seals differ. ",
