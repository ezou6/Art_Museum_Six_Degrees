He adopted this serial approach with the <em>Apollo</em> series, a body of paintings in which he used vertical stripes of varying colors and thicknesses. He created the distinctive surfaces of these works by applying paint with tools such as brushes and sponges or pressing it through a textile. Natkin explored variants on this composition in paintings over decades and also returned to the works in a group of lithographic prints, such as this one. Here the distinctive textures of his paintings are recreated on the stone surface used to make this print.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
