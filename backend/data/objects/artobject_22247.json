The artist’s evolution away from the classically descriptive, Claudian compositions of his early career had begun nearly forty years earlier, in Barbizon-influenced canvases of the 1850s whose limited scope, ambiguous space, and blurred outlines anticipate the brooding, enigmatic intensity fully realized in works executed during the last fifteen years of his life. A student of the &shy;eighteenth-century Swedish scientist-mystic &shy;Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed the earthly, material world was continuous with the heavenly and spiritual realm, Inness sought to combine the two in a visual approximation of the \"correspondence\" Swedenborg posited between them. This version of <I>The Home of the Heron</I>, one of several distinct depictions of the subject by the artist, epitomizes the hazy, twilight ambience — painstakingly achieved through successive glazing and scumbling of the paint surface — that Inness employed to achieve this end, in which matter and atmosphere seem melded together in a scene at once palpable and intangible.</P></SPAN></SPAN>",
