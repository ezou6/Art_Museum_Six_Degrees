That grand thoroughfare, the city’s cultural and commercial artery, was also the main parade route for the nation. Hassam had a window onto the country’s increasing involvement in World War I when his studio moved further uptown, closer to the center of those patriotic displays. He recalled, \"There was that Preparedness Day, and I looked up the avenue and saw these wonderful flags waving, and I painted the series of flag pictures after that.\" The flag-covered streets and Impressionist images of Bastille Day had captivated Hassam during his early days in Paris. An Impressionist concern with the effects of weather and light exhibited in the works he produced there and in his earlier New York canvases gave way to more formal explorations and symbolic undertones as his flag series progressed. Of the approximately thirty flag images the artist made between 1916 and 1919, <I>Rainy Day, Fifth Avenue</I> marks a pivotal turning point in this development. Rain provides a pretext to dissolve the canvas into a harmony of red, white, and blue, while the American flag becomes both a pattern and a parallel of the swarms of people below. </P></SPAN>",

Hassam’s anonymized rendering of the parade expresses a pluralistic conception of patriotism, reflecting a modern, corporate construction of citizenship, in which communal rather than individual acts are prioritized.\n",
