            "textentryhtml":"The bodhisattva Guanyin in the manifestation of a young lady with bare feet carrying a basket with a fish. This illustrates the variously told tale of a beautiful lady in the Tang dynasty who was offered marriage by many suitors. She consented to marry the person who could memorize a series of Buddhist sutras, but on the night of the wedding she died. Later, a monk appeared before the husband, Mr. Ma (hence, Fish-basket Guanyin is also known as “Mr. Ma’s wife” ), and when they opened her coffin, nothing was left except bones linked by a gold chain, the sign of a holy personage, particularly a bodhisattva. Such tales gained popularity in China during the Song dynasty and the fishmonger, who is not whom she seems, comes to be identified with Guanyin. On the carved stone from which this rubbing was taken, there is an inscription dated to 1617 and the stone carver is named as Dong Daben. [It appears from unclear additional inscriptions at bottom left, that the image was later recut by a Buddhist disciple named Tong at Shaolin Temple, and the recarved stone may also have been done by Dong Daben].",
