The upper right scene shows man seated on a mat near a tree. He carries a pot in his left hand from which smoke rises and turns into a dragon at left. The lower right scene shows a large figure seated in a cave. In front of the cave is a pine tree at left, a smaller figure kneels paying respect at right. In the scene at upper right, in a rocky landscape a man sits on a stone accompanied by a tiger. The scene at lower right depicts a man seated by a stream near a pine tree. He looks across the stream at a waterfall. </p><p><br>The pictorial stones from which this rubbing was taken is presently located in the stele corridor of the Fengxiang Museum 鳳翔博物館 in Shaanxi province. The stones were engraved by Zhou Mingqi in 1906 and originally installed in the Su Wenzhong Shrine 蘇文忠公祠 at East Lake in Fengxiang. “Wenzhong” is the posthumous title of Su Shi 蘇軾 (1037-1101). The 1906 inscription by Zhou Mingqi records that the model for the pictorial images were ink on silk paintings by the Five Dynasties painter Zhu You that copied wall paintings by the Tang dynasty painter Wu Daozi. According to Mi Fu’s 米芾 (1051-1107) Hua shi 畫史 (Painting history), Su Shi owned these paintings after they had fallen into bad condition when in the possession of Chen Hanxiang 陳漢鄉, and then were subsequently remounted by Xianyu Zijun 鮮于子駿, an acquaintance of Su Shi. Zhou Mingqi reports that he purchased the paintings in the form of eight album leaves from a He 何 family living to the north of Fengxiang. From the eight, he selected four leaves that were more complete, and asked the official Guo Chong 國崇, who excelled at the double-outline method (shuanggou 雙鉤), to be cut them into stone. He then installed them in the shrine for Su Shi by East Lake. <br></p>",
