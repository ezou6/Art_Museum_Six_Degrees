            "textentryhtml":"<p>As evidenced in Untitled (Hold) 33, Schmidt's process is not simply additive, which is to say he does not just apply paint to a support, whether canvas or board. Instead, he builds or constructs his paintings much as a sculptor would a sculpture. In Schmidt's case, he repurposes scraps left over from the creation of previous works and assembles them to form new collage paintings. The seams between these cast-off pieces of wood, vinyl, and cardboard-seams that Schmidt always allows to remain visible-serve as compositional devices: they divide and articulate and what would otherwise be an uninterrupted support. The paint Schmidt adds to the semi-completed works alternately obeys and disregards these gaps. The resulting works are hybrid objects-part paintings, part collages, part sculptures. Displaying signs of wear and tear, they also privilege process over product. Paradoxically, Schmidt's works appear to be coming together and falling apart at the same time, merging the activity of construction with that of deconstruction. At the large scale of Untitled (Hold) 33, this paradoxical condition is uniquely visible.\n</p><p> <br />\nLike all of Schmidt’s work, Untitled (Hold) 33 is deeply engaged with the history of modernist painting. In its highly elaborated, almost mannered, surface, the painting presents itself foremost as a site of activity that is both physical and conceptual, as though the artist is materializing what it would mean to work through the history of twentieth-century abstraction through a process of replication, deviation, and synthesis. Art historical precedents are too numerous to meaningfully name, but one trajectory of particular significance to Schmidt is that of the collage painting as developed by Jean Arp and Kurt Schwitters in the prewar period and Ellsworth Kelly and Dorothea Rockburne in the postwar period. That Schmidt’s work adopts collage paintings’ simultaneous insistence on internal coherence and rupture can be understood as a meta-reflection on his relationship to modernist painting, which is one of both continuity and break.\n<br />\nSchmidt holds degrees from the University of Fine Arts, Hamburg (2003) and the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna (2006). His work has been featured in several solo exhibitions at galleries in New York, San Francisco, Austria, Milan, and France. He has been showing in group exhibitions since 2000 at museums and galleries all over Europe. In addition to the Princeton University Art Museum, his work is included in the collections of MUMOK and MAK in Vienna.\n</p>",
