            "textentryhtml":"\r\nA suffering Christ with a triangular nimbus and crown of thorns sits alone in a niche. His glowing flesh pulses with life and pain against the cold stone. Yet his body already bears the stigmata, the five wounds of the Crucifixion. Pierced and bleeding, his right hand is lifted in a sign of blessing. This is the Man of Sorrows, a mystical image for contemplation, rooted in late-medieval devotional practice, showing Christ simultaneously living and dead. The image draws upon many sources, including a relic — Veronica’s Veil (Christ’s face was miraculously imprinted on the saint’s veil as she wiped his brow on the road to Calvary) — and the legendary Mass of Saint Gregory (the Man of Sorrows appeared to the saint while he celebrated mass, and Christ’s wounds bled into the chalice to demonstrate the doctrine of transubstantiation). The realism of Christ’s living body emphasizes his human suffering, yet, as a body brought to life again after death, also conveys the hope that through his suffering, he offers eternal life to all.</P>\r\nGoltzius, the preeminent Dutch engraver, began to paint late in life. <I>Man of Sorrows with a Chalice</I> echoes the work of his teacher, Maarten van&nbsp;Heemskerck (1498–1574), whose expressive muscular figures were informed by Michelangelo and Classical antiquity, sources that Goltzius himself saw during a trip to Italy in 1590–91. He also invigorates his Christ with new vitality based on studies of living models in the Haarlem academy. </P></SPAN>",

            "textentryhtml":"<p>\n\tEach year on Good Friday, the Book of Common Prayer prescribes a passage from Isaiah 53 that is traditionally associated with Jesus as the Man of Sorrows: “Surely he has borne our  infirmities.” In this painting, we see that the one who takes on the brokenness of the world is also the one who gives the sacraments to the church for its healing. The empty chalice is held at an angle, as if its contents have just been spilled out; the blood poured out in suffering is also the cup of salvation. The identity of Jesus as God incarnate is attested by two Trinitarian symbols: the faint triangle behind his head and the position of his right hand in a gesture of blessing. Goltzius reminds us that a mere man, even the most virtuous man, cannot redeem humanity. According to Christian theology, only God can do that.\n</p>\n<p><b>\n\tThe Rev. Canon Dr. Kara N. Slade</b>, Associate Rector, Trinity Church; Canon Theologian of the Diocese of New Jersey\n</p>",
