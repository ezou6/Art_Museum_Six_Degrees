The artist began <I>Great American Nudes</I>, the series for which he is best known, in 1961. These contemporary odalisques mimic those of neoclassical painters like Ingres and modern artists such as Matisse as much as they do mass-produced soft-core erotica. Stripped of both their clothes and their personalities, Wesselmann’s nudes resemble objects more than people. The artist was one of many who abandoned the square or rectangular canvas in favor of the shaped canvas in the 1960s: here, the outlines of the support reiterate the curves of the woman’s body.</P></SPAN>",
