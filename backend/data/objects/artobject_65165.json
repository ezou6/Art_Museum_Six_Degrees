Such is the spectacle created by <EM>Double Poke in the Eye&nbsp;II</EM>, one of Bruce Nauman’s last works to utilize &shy;commercial-grade neon. As early as 1965–66, &shy;Nauman began to experiment with neon. This new body of work consisted of neither objects nor paintings but what the artist called \"signs.\" Often employing alliterations, anagrams, puns, palindromes, rebuses, inversions, and rhymes, Nauman’s early neons were among the first works of art to utilize light and language as materials. His&nbsp;neons from the early to mid-1980s, by contrast, include both linguistic and figurative elements. Almost without fail, they address the antinomies of the human condition — sex and death, love and cruelty, humor and tragedy — as well as politically inflected current events. <EM>Double Poke in the Eye II</EM> is a riff on the platitude \"Better than a poke in the eye [with a sharp stick].\" A switching mechanism regulates the tempo of illumination, while the combination of malicious behavior and bewitching color exemplifies the artist’s commitment to contradiction and incongruity. </P></SPAN>",

In <I>Double Poke in the Eye II</I>, Nauman employed neon tubing and static animation, methods of commercial advertisement, to create a vignette of human action and retort—here either humorous and playful or vengeful and violent. His first professional studio was a San Francisco storefront from which he looked out onto neon advertisements in the windows of neighborhood stores and bars. A desire to bridge the divide between one’s everyday surroundings and the subjects, materials, and concepts of artistic practice was a motivating force for many American artists of the 1960s and ‘70s. </P></SPAN>",
