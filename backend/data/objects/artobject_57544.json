During an offering to deter impediments to having children he saw a painted portrait in elegant and special brushwork; [this was a portrait] of Zhang Xian. [It was said that] prayers [to this portrait] would be answered, so [Su Xun] exchanged a jade huan ring for it. Xun did not have children and everyday burned incense and prayed [to it]. After several years, he got [his sons] [Su] Shi and [Su] Zhe, both of whom were studious by nature. From this we know that the Immortal is eager to help and connect with people, and my words [prayers to Zhang Xian] to deter impediments to having children are not nonsense. For this reason, I record them from start to finish to let those in the future who want to pray for children and [so that after their prayers are also answered they] can add to these words of respect, words of their own. \r\nPraying on the shangyuan day [i.e., 15th day of 1st month] in the wuzi cyclical year of the Qingli reign. Su Xun from Ba [i.e., Sichuan], writes with bowed head.\r\nNotes:\r\n1. Yuju Guan玉局觀, a Daoist monastery during the Song dynasty located north of Chengdu, Sichuan province. \r\n\r\nLower:\r\nSu Xun 蘇洵 (1009-1066), offering prayer to Zhang Xian:\r\n維某年某月某日，\r\n具位某等昭告於\r\n真人曰：惟\r\n神好生為德，化行四\r\n海。某等不德所召，\r\n艱於嗣息，堇皈\r\n遺教，瞻奉尊顏。\r\n仰覬\r\n神庥，下從愚悃。品儀\r\n不腆，神其鑒佑 。\r\n尚饗。\r\n夫婦行四拜禮，詣\r\n香案上香、獻酒、讀\r\n祝，再四拜。焚祝禮\r\n畢， 用細米粉圓\r\n成彈子，染五色，煮\r\n熟共一盤，茶三甌，\r\n酒三盞，棗湯三甌，\r\n鹿脯一方，無則\r\n以羊肉代之，\r\n時果三品，不用\r\n錢馬。\r\n用仲春 \r\n仲秋上旬\r\n宜祭祀日。\r\nDraft translation:\r\n“On X day of the Y month in the Z year, in reverence we announce to the Immortal, saying: The Deity loves and protects life as a virtue, putting this into force across the Four Seas. We who lack virtue . . . have had difficulty in having sons . . . . I beg you partake of this sacrifice. Husband and wife will carry out the ritual of bowing four times, advance to the altar table with censers and light the incense, offer wine, read the prayer, and the bow four more times. The ritual of burning the prayer completed, use fine rice powder and roll them into pellets, color them in five colors, boil them together in a basin, [and also offer] three cups of tea, three small cups of wine, three cups of date soup, and a piece of deer breast. If without [deer breast] use mutton as a substitute for it. [Also offer] three seasonal fruits, but do not use qianma (votive money). Use the first third of the second months of spring or autumn to announce the day of the sacrifice. \r\n",
