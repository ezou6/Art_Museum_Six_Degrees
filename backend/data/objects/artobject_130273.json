            "textentryhtml":"<p>This carte de visite from 1864 offers an example of how photography advocated for emancipation when circulated among Northern whites. The carte de visite was a pocket-sized photograph that could be distributed widely. This image was circulated as part of a publicity campaign mounted by Union General Nathaniel P. Banks to raise money for educating formerly enslaved people in Louisiana. The emancipated Black people pictured here were brought to New York to be photographed in staged studio settings and to participate in fundraising events in the North. The figures in this photograph, each of whom holds a book, are identified on the card as “Wilson, Charley, Rebecca, and Rosa.” A related article in the January 30, 1864, issue of <a href=\"https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015021733780&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=77&amp;skin=2021&amp;q1=Isaac%20White\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\"><font face=\"Calibri\" size=\"3\"><span lang=\"EN\"><em>Harper’s Weekly</em></span></font></font></a>&nbsp;identifies them further as Wilson Chinn, Charles Taylor, Rebecca Huger, and Rosina Downs and describes both the difficulty and cruelty of their lives in Louisiana—and, in the case of the children, the silky texture of their hair as well as their blonde complexions. This description exemplifies an abolitionist strategy that stressed the whiteness of some enslaved people in an effort to undermine the perceived difference between the presumed white audience and Black people, rhetoric that proceeds from a troubling fascination with the mutability of racial categories. This photograph also illustrates another abolitionist strategy: humanizing Black people by naming the sitters in the caption and stressing their ability to read and educate themselves.</p><p><br></p>",
