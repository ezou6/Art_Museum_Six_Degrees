            "textentryhtml":"<p>\n\tLate in his life, Rubens received two large and important commissions from King Philip IV of Spain. For the Torre de la Parada, the king’s hunting lodge outside Madrid, Rubens devised more than sixty mythological scenes, among them this oil sketch of the young Ganymede abducted by Jupiter in the guise of an eagle. For the Alcázar, Philip’s city palace, the king ordered a series of eighteen hunts; Rubens departed from the mythological account by the ancient Roman author Ovid in his <i>Metamorphoses</i> and instead portrayed the death of Adonis as a hunting accident. These quick and direct oil sketches demonstrate the assured touch and virtuoso economy of means by which Rubens conveyed his subjects.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n</p>",
