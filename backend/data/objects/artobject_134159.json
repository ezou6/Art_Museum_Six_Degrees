The model for both was Giuseppe Valona; according to an observer, Valona was “a man of fine proportions” who, “weary one day of posing in the studio, threw himself back, stretched out his arms and gave a great yawn. Leighton saw the whole performance and fixed it roughly in clay straight off.” This anecdote suggests that the artist was inspired by the model’s spontaneous movement, although in fact Leighton had been exploring the same contrapposto pose as early as 1869. The work was seen as a response to the younger Thornycroft’s <em>Teucer</em>, and was immediately admired for its move “from hardness into suppleness and flexibility.”<br></p><p><br></p>",
