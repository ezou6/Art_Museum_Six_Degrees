Although the culture is most famous for intricate embroidered textiles, wrapped in many layers around mummies, Paracas ceramics also merit appreciation. Such objects were incised with the outlines of their dense, often geometric designs while the clay was still leather-hard. After firing, the vessels were painted with mineral pigments suspended in plant resin. The resin then may have been carefully heated, as no brushmarks are evident. This technique allowed for brilliant coloration in a wide range of hues. Powerful animals and supernatural creatures, including the so-called Oculate Being, appear with frequency. </P>",

The position of the eyes would have made these masks impractical for actual use, but it is possible they once adorned mummy bundles. The mask portrays a common supernatural in Paracas art known as the “Oculate Being” due to his oversized eyes. The Oculate Being frequently features two-headed snakes that slither across his face, and his nose projects dramatically outward. Three rays emanate below the smiling, toothy mouth that may represent a tongue and fangs; the central ray is additionally adorned with a tiny long-tailed creature. In full-figure portrayals, the Oculate Being often holds a trophy head and a knife, suggesting that he was associated with ritual sacrifice and decapitation. ",
