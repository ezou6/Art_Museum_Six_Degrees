In this case the dedication would have been made by Titus Flavius, son of Cyrus, and by [ . . .}imius (Septimius?), son of Apollonides, and lines 10 and 11 might be the last of the original inscription. \nThe surface of the stone is much worn in the center and in the upper right corner, so that it is impossible to determine how far to the right the first five preserved lines may have been extended. Lines 8, 10, and 11 extend across the whole width of the fragment, but the fragment is so incomplete that the length and contents of these lines give no indication of the original size of the inscription. There are no traces of letters above line 1, but they might have been completely effaced. Line 7 evidently did not extend as far as the preserved portion of line 8, since the end of the preserved portion of line 8 is clear and any letters inscribed immediately above it would presumably appear; line 9 likewise appears to have ended with the iοta which alone is preserved. The spaces between lines 5 and 6, 9 and 10, and 10 and 11 were presumably blank, since these spaces are all 2.1 cm. in height and thus are too small for two lines and too large for one line of letters such as are used elsewhere, the letters being 1.1 cm. in height and the space between adjacent lines 0.4 cm. \nLine 2: ] γυνα̣ι̣κόѕ\nLine 3: possibly uìο`]ѕ̣ αυτοũ\nLine 8: it seen impossible to find a satisfactory restoration of the following άρχων",
