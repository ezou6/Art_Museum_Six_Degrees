Works like <I>Love Accepted</I> culminate nearly a century of experiments with abstract painting, and it was championed by modernists such as Clement Greenberg and Michael Fried for just this reason. No matter how resolute his rejection of illusionism, however, Olitski’s evocative titles suggest a lingering attachment to narrative, especially as it pertains to love, desire, and passion. </P></SPAN>",
