Its story centers on Maud, the titular daughter once content in her childhood innocence but later seduced by a wealthy squire’s son, who ultimately abandons her and their illegitimate child. In this scene, Maud guilelessly takes strawberries from the hand of her future lover while her father works in the background. The commanding pose of the squire’s son, contrasted by Maud’s self-contained deference, perhaps hints at the tragedy to come.",

The composition illustrates lines from <EM>The Woodman's Daughter </EM>by the Victorian poet Coventry Patmore (1823–96), first published in 1844. Much admired by the Pre-Raphaelites, Patmore’s poem tells the tragic tale of Maud, a poor woodman’s daughter who is happy in her childhood innocence before she is seduced over time by the wealthy squire’s son, who ultimately abandons her with their illegitimate child. In the drawing, as in the finished painting, Millais represents Maud guilelessly receiving strawberries from the squire’s son, rendered with the graphic simplicity of a fairytale. </P></SPAN></SPAN>",
