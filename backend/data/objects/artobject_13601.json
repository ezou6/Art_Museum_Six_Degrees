Drawings made after the nude, such as this one, were executed by students or by a professor, as an example for the class. Instruction was tightly regimented at the French academy: students first drew countless copies after engravings in line alone, progressing to the study of tonal values drawn in colored chalk from plaster casts of antique sculpture. Only after a proficient level of mastery had been achieved were students finally allowed to draw directly from live models.",
