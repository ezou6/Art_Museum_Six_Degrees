Steinbach's assemblage occupies an unresolved place in the gallery: it is both sculpture and painting. The shelf on which the cutlery rests is equally ambiguous: it belongs to the work of art, but is also an independent entity, a structure that supports the knives. In its supporting role, the shelf self-consciously mimics the pedestals on which more traditional sculptures lie, as well as the prosaic displays found in stores and supermarkets.",
