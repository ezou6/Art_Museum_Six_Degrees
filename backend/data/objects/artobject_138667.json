Located at Bab-al-Kalabsha, just south of Aswan, it was the largest freestanding temple in Lower Nubia and was dedicated to the Nubian god Mandulis and the Egyptian deities Isis and Osiris. Built during the reign of the first Roman emperor, Augustus, when Rome’s influence was growing stronger in the region, the building features slender columns and wide intercolumnar spacing that recall Greco-Roman architectural practices, while the temple plan—with its monumental gateway leading into an open-air forecourt followed by a columned hall—is typical of this region in Egypt. Roberts and Haghe’s prints were a crucial vehicle through which images of Egypt circulated in western Europe and North America in the nineteenth century.\n</p>",
