            "textentryhtml":"The bodhisattva Guanyin in the manifestation of a young lady with bare feet carrying a basket with a fish. This illustrates the variously told tale of a beautiful lady in the Tang dynasty who was offered marriage by many suitors. She consented to marry the person who could memorize a series of Buddhist sutras, but on the night of the wedding she died. Later, a monk appeared before the husband, Mr. Ma (hence, Fish-basket Guanyin is also known as “Mr. Ma’s wife” ), and when they opened her coffin, nothing was left except bones linked by a gold chain, the sign of a holy personage, particularly a bodhisattva. Such tales gained popularity in China during the Song dynasty and the fishmonger, who is not whom she seems, comes to be identified with Guanyin. This rubbing has selectively chosen red ink for the figure’s robes, hands, lips, topknot, and basket and handle and fish, while the remaining hair, neck, inner lapels, bare feet, and bottom of the basket are in black ink. The background was left blank as exposed paper, and above is a black-ink inscription. ",
