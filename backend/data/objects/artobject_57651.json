His achievements were glorified after his death to the extent that he was deified during the Sui dynasty and became a paradigm of loyalty and righteousness. He is portrayed standing facing to the right wearing a sword on his belt with his right hand on his hip and left on his chest under his long beard. According to the inscription by the official Lao Bingshen, on the left, this image follows a painting by Gao Qipei that he had acquired. The pictorial stone from which this rubbing was taken is the back side of a stele carved in 1849 hat is presently in the Dingzhou Stone Inscriptions Museum 定州石刻館, Dingzhou, Hubei province. The stele front is carved with a picture pf bamboo in wind and rain, which was said originally to have been painted in red ink by Guan Yu. ",
