Wenyou Tai文遊臺 terrace, located about two miles northeast of present-day Gaoyou 高郵 (also called Qinyou 秦郵) city, Jiangsu province. It was originally built in 976. The Yangzhou gazetteer (Yangzhou fu zhi 揚州府志，“Guji” 古跡 section) records that in the Song dynasty Su Shi 蘇軾, Wang Gong 王鞏, Qin Guan 秦觀, and Li Gonglin 李公麟 had together traveled there to write and drink; hence the name “wenyou.” Li Gonglin made a painting and cut in stone. \r\n2. \r\nSeated at the table:\r\nSong Maochu 宋茂初 (1794 juren degree) \r\nzi: Shifu 實甫, from Gaoyou.

His name comes at the end of the preface, which was composed by Zhou Kun, he is not portrayed in the image, and he seems to be junior to the other participants and therefore not likely to have been the carving agent or sponsor. He may have been the portraitist.\r\n",

Located in Gaoyou 高郵 (also called Qinyou 秦郵) city, Jiangsu province, the Terrace was originally built in the Song dynasty in 976 at the destination where literati figures, including Su Shi 蘇軾 (1036-1101) and Huang Tingjian 黃庭堅 (1045-1105), had traveled and gathered together to write and drink. Three men are shown seated around a table inside a building. In front is an overhanging pine tree, under which one figure is seated on the ground at the tree’s base, while two others stand on the other side of the doorway. On the terrace at left overlooking a lake, two men sit at the rear, one stands at the low wall pointing outwards, and two younger men stand in front. The names and titles of each figure is identified in the preface composed by Zhou Kun 周鯤 (late Qing dynasty) inscribed above the scene. The landscape was painted by Kong Zhaoduo 孔昭鐸 (late Qing dynasty), and the portrait painter may be Li Xiaobai 李斆白 (late Qing dynasty). The painting was carved into stone by Shen Jie 沈捷 (late Qing dynasty). The participants in pictured, or involved in, the production of this pictorial stone are mainly based in the Jiangsu area. </p><p><br>The year 1842 is when the Prefectural Department Magistrate (zhoumu 州牧) of Gaoyou 高郵 Zuo Huichun 左輝春 (late Qing dynasty), one of the men pictured in the scene, completed repairs on the Terrace. He had carved stones set into the walls. In front was the Spring Festival of Purification at the Terrace of Literary Travels stone and one celebrating Su Shi’s birthday (祝宋蘇文忠公生日圖 or 祝東坡生日圖; PUAM y1958-249), in back was a portrait of Su Shi (東坡小像), and to the sides were calligraphy by Su Shi and Huang Tingjian. The carved stone from which this rubbing was taken is currently located in the complex that includes the Wenyou Tai terrace, but is now set in a wall of the Hezan Tang 盍簪堂 hall compound.<br></p>",
