This laminated exhibition panel, made in collaboration with her life partner, Terry Dennett, illustrates the therapeutic role that photography played for Spence as a means of investigating and dealing with her cancer, while highlighting larger questions about women’s identities, states of health, and control over their own bodies. Gesturing toward the complexities of care and choice, Spence noted: “I have had to face the fact that I am totally vulnerable, able to die, to feel terror, to be terrorized, but able to fight back with the help of others.”",
