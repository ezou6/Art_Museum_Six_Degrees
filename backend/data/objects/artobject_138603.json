When she showed them to me, I wondered why some looked skeletal and some resembled our father, gone twenty-five years; our mother, who had died two years earlier; and my own somber face as well as Hannah’s, as if we were all entwined within her. In 1987, when Hannah visited again, she showed me a lump in her neck that was soon diagnosed as lymphoma. Undaunted, she continued to paint the watercolor self-portraits in larger sizes, some monumental, and later, in the hospital, she drew her <i>Intra Venus Faces</i> and <i>Hands</i>. Hannah titled the watercolor self-portraits <i>Before Cancer (B.C.)</i> since they had emerged so presciently from within as intimations of approaching illness and her eventual death in 1993.\n</p>\n<p><b>\n\tMarsie Scharlatt</b>, Hannah Wilke Collection &amp; Archive, Los Angeles\n\t<br />\n</p>",
