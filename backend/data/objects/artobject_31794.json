In these performances, which frequently involved the audience, Dine utilized hand-painted sets and props in a way that had a profound effect on his later studio practice. Here, tools suspended from multiple canvases riddle the distinctions between painting and sculpture and two- and three-dimensionality; they also seem to invite the viewer to take up the art of painting. The combination of real brushes and gardening tools suggests a humorous twist on landscape painting, which here is equated with the pedestrian activities of weeding and planting.",
