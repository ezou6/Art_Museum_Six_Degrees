A friend to luminaries such as Allan Kaprow, one of whose earliest Happenings occurred on his chicken farm in South Brunswick, Segal embarked in 1961 on the work for which he is best known: figurative sculptures made from white plaster, often paired with everyday objects or placed in environments intended to represent quotidian places such as diners, buses, kitchens, and parking garages. Even when they depict a group of individuals, Segal’s sculptures often convey a sense of isolation and social anomie, thanks in part to the suppression of expression and individuality entailed by his method. In <EM>Woman on White Wicker Rocker</EM>, for instance, a bronze edition of an original plaster, the figure’s demeanor suggests introspection, melancholia, and apprehension all at once. </P></SPAN>",

To create this sculpture, he wrapped the model with bandages in sections, removing the pieces when they hardened and reassembling them to create a shell. He then made a mold to cast the form in bronze, which was painted white to echo the original plaster. Segal’s sculptures often convey a sense of isolation, due in part to the suppression of expression and individual features. He also required his sitters to remain still for extended periods of time while wrapped in bandages, which may contribute to the sense of remoteness conveyed by his figures.",
