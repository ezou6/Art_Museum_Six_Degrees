She moved to New York in 1945, at a moment when the city was on the verge of becoming a thriving center of twentieth-century American art. Her success blossomed in the 1950s when she was included in two of the decade’s defining exhibitions—12 Americans at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the European touring exhibition The New American Painting. Life magazine described her as “the most celebrated of the young American women painters.” The year she made Wilma, Hartigan was appointed director of the graduate painting program at the Maryland Institute College of Art, where she would teach for the next four decades.",
