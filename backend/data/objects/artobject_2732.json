Synonymous with the Revolutionary War site and the famed military academy, West Point was also admired for its natural beauty by landscape artists such as Doughty. He painted several grand panoramic vistas from this vantage point—looking northward to the Hudson Highlands, which dramatically frame the water. </P></SPAN>",

By the 1830s, he was painting scenery in the New York area, such as this dramatic view of the Hudson River. Doughty’s watercolor not only evokes a familiar site with military associations, but also points toward the larger connotations of a commanding prospect. Its panoramic sweep speaks to an expansive, even imperial, vision of the American landscape that goes back to Thomas Jefferson, who in his first inaugural address in 1801 spoke of \"a rising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful land .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye.\";</P></SPAN>",
