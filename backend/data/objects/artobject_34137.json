Like his brother-in-law Ambrosius Bosschaert, with whom he trained, Van der Ast painted flower and fruit still lifes but added novelties to the genre that set his paintings apart. Numerous insects, notoriously short-lived, animate the work. Rather than showing flowers in a vase, he depicts individual blooms scattered on the ledge, out of water. Plums are shown in various stages of ripeness; one has been bruised or partially eaten. The tropical shells arrayed in the foreground, a firm nod to the Dutch global empire, had likely been transported by the East and West India Companies\n\nto Holland, where they were avidly collected. The openings of the shells have been turned from view, emphasizing their forms and surfaces rather than the lives that once inhabited them. Together, these elements may have served as reminders of the fragility and fleetingness of life.\n",

Balthasar van der Ast, who was established in Middelburg and Utrecht before spending the greatest part of his career in Delft, painted combinations of flowers, fruits, and shells, either gathering the flowers in vases or spreading them on tables, as here. He was one of the earliest artists to add insects, like the worm, bumblebee, and mayfly in this painting. Hidden meanings are common in still life and can range from the cycle of seasons (spring flowers &shy;contrasting with summer fruits) to the continents (the exotic shells evoking distant oceans). On a spiritual level, the still life alludes to the <i>vanitas</i> theme since one of the plums has been partially eaten, and an insect’s life is notoriously short. <p></p><em>Handbook of the Collections, 2013</em>",

Strewn across an unadorned stone ledge are flowers, shells, and fruits; behind them, across the back wall, spans a soft beam of light. Insects inject the stillness of this arrangement with a sense of movement.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\" dir=\"LTR\">Van der Ast plays with the different meanings associated with his compositional elements that may have come to viewers’ minds. The cut flowers and half-eaten plum suggest life’s ephemerality, and yet the liveliness of the insects counterbalances this theme of <i>vanitas</i>. The numerous shells might have served as an admonishment against material possession; perhaps in evoking exotic, faraway lands they also demonstrate an appreciation of the beauty and diversity of God’s creation.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\" dir=\"LTR\"></p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\" dir=\"LTR\"><em>Ezra Shin, Princeton Class of 2024</em></p></span>",
