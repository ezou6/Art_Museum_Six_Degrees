By the end of the nineteenth century, Peto’s compositions were regularly passed off as by Harnett, due to the latter’s greater contemporary acclaim—and the superior market value of paintings signed by him. <I>The Marked Passage</I> is one such example, in which the forged signature \"WM Harnett\" only partially obscures that of \"JF Peto,\" the painting’s creator. </P>\r\nThe reader of the upper book marked his page with a pipe and laid a burnt wooden match on the edge of the lower book. These actions suggest transitory moments, in contrast to the long use of the books, as indicated by their worn leather bindings. A tobacco container seems to hover mysteriously on a dark shelf over this quotidian scene. </P></SPAN></SPAN>\r\n<P>&nbsp;</P>",
