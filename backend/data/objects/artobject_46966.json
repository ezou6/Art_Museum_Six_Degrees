            "textentryhtml":"Part of a commission for the English eccentric William Beckford’s Revelation Chamber at Fonthill Abbey, his fantastic Gothic Revival folly in Wiltshire, these richly developed oil sketches are—as the arched shape of one suggests—likely studies for stained-glass windows. Each illustrates a passage from the New Testament’s apocalyptic Book of Revelation, in which God vanquishes the powers of evil and ushers in a righteous messianic kingdom. Beckford’s fabulous wealth derived from several Jamaican sugar plantations, at which three thousand people were enslaved. He paid West a substantial retainer to assist his designs for Fonthill, including the planned Chamber, with walls five feet thick, in order to receive his family’s coffins. However, the chamber disappeared from Beckford’s evolving plans, and Fonthill Abbey, declared finished in 1813, was demolished following the third collapse of its hastily constructed three-hundred-foot tower.\n",

Although its fantastic imagery suggests the first category, <I>Woman Clothed with the Sun</I> in fact closely illustrates a passage from the New Testament’s apocalyptic book of Revelation, wherein a woman, probably representing Israel, delivers a child from the pursuit of a dragon, said to represent Christ and Satan, respectively: \"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And behold a great red dragon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.\" This work is part of a commission for William Beckford’s unrealized Revelation Chamber at Fonthill Abbey, his fabulous Gothic Revival folly in Wiltshire. As its arched shape suggests, it is likely a study for a stained-glass window. </P></SPAN>",
