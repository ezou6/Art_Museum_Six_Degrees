            "textentryhtml":"At first glance, these two figures have little in common: they were created at different times, represent distinct genders, and likely come from dissimilar contexts. However, when viewed from the back, both portraits show signs of having been made from marble that was previously carved. The sculpture of a man has vegetal ornamentation and wings spouting from his head, suggesting that it was originally a column capital. Behind the woman’s neck is another female head, likely the goddess Athena, identifiable by the helmet pushed up off her face. The differences between the two sides of each bust illustrate the Roman practice of reusing materials for new purposes, which often occurred in regions where marble was relatively inaccessible or when a portrait depicted an individual whose memory had been condemned. While the precise circumstances in which these two portraits were adapted are unknown, their visible histories give us a glimpse into their complex lives.",
