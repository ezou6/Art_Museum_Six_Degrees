Incised jewelry, so-called “spoons,” masklike faces, and complexly modeled animal, human, and supernatural figures, all of Middle Formative date (1000–500 B.C.) and carved in Olmec style, have been discovered throughout most of Mesoamerica, from Costa Rica to the central Mexican Highlands to the southwest Mexican coast in the present-day state of Guerrero. </P>",

            "textentryhtml":"These seventeen human legs and four pebble shaped pieces of jadeite once comprised quite curious necklace.  When strung together the legs each would have faced forward, reminding the mind of a modern viewer, perhaps, of a chorus line.  The symbolic value of the row of legs is unknown.  Although relatively rare, other naturalistically rendered body parts are attested from Middle Formative Mesoamerica, which may be a part of a larger complex of symbolic associations.  The legs are similar in basic form, with flat, schematic feet, bulbous knees, and fleshy calves.  Each varies slightly in size, shape, and color.  Their original arrangement in the necklace is not known; they may have place the longer legs at the center of the necklace as displayed today, or they may have been organized to produce contrast in size and/or color from one leg to the next.  The jadeite of the set ranges in color from a light, whitish green to a deep, forest green.  Although jadeite is often considered a green stone, in its pure state it is white.  The green coloration is produced through interaction with other minerals, wherein iron is substituted in the chemical composition of the jadeite, imbuing it with green coloration.  Although the only verified source of jadeite in Mesoamerica is in southern Guatemela, it has long been thought that another source exists in Guerrero, Mexico, the same region where this neckalce was found.",
