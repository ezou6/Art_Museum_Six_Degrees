The round jar is decorated with wisteria blossoms, flowers, birds, and butterflies in silver wire and colored enamels against a background of glossy black enamel, and has a similarly decorated lid with a bud-form finial. It is signed Namikawa of Kyoto (Namikawa Yasuyuki) on a silver plaque at the base. Namikawa Yasuyuki, along with &shy;Namikawa So¯kyosuke (1847–1910), was one of the most famous Japanese enamelers. He expanded both the aesthetic and the technical boundaries of the medium and is particularly known for his invention of glossy black enamel, which he began producing in 1879.</P>\r\nThe slender vase has a short, flared neck and is decorated with trailing wisteria blossoms in colored enamels on a light blue ground. Stamped on the base is the name Goto¯, for Goto¯ Seizaburo¯, as well as a mark that indicates pure silver was used for the vase. Goto¯ ran a large cloisonné factory in the city of Yokohama with the cooperation of Tanaka Kichisaburo¯, who, like So¯suke, had trained with the German scientist Gottfried von Wagner (1831–1891). Wagner was largely responsible for introducing important technical features of later Japanese &shy;cloisonné production.</P>\r\nDuring the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, Japanese cloisonné methods underwent a rapid transition.
