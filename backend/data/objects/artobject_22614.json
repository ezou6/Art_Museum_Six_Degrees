The prominent Philadelphia lawyer had shocked his Federalist peers by supporting Democrat Andrew Jackson, whose election as president in 1828 garnered Kane the position of city solicitor that year—a plausible reason for the insertion of the later date as a commemorative gesture. The portrait occupies an important place in Neagle’s work in being among the first to show its subject in action rather than self-consciously posing. Depicted consulting a presumably legal volume, Kane looks to his left, against the rightward cant of his book and body, supplying a pictorial animation amplified by the shadows surrounding him, in keeping with the increased expressiveness and liveliness of Romantic-era portraiture.\n",
