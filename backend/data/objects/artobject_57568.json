            "textentryhtml":"Bodhidharma, an Indian sage (5th-6th century) who is said to have transmitted Chan Buddhism to China, is shown standing on a reed in swirling waves. According to legend, he is said to have miraculously crossed the Yangzi River on a broken-off reed (zhewei dujiang 折葦渡江) in order to travel to Shaolin Si monastery on Mount Song, Henan province. Wearing a robe with a cowl, he looks to towards his right with a halo behind his head. At middle right is inscribed the name of Wang Shicai 王施財 from Huizhou, who may be the person responsible for carving the image into stone. At bottom right, is a cutoff inscription that suggests that a certain Shi Zhongsheng 士仲昇 may have executed the original design as part of a brocade screen. At upper left is cursive-script inscription signed by a calligrapher that has yet to be identified. Beneath this is a regular-script inscription noting that the pictorial stone from which this rubbing was taken was erected 1544 at the Shaolin Si monastery. At far left are found traces of a short inscription that only incorporates a few characters, hiding what may have been areas of damage with ink. ",
