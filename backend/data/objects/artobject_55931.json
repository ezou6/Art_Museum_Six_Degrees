This six-chambered bell or rattle is reportedly from that site.  Bells of similar form, as indicated by their position when found in the famous burials of Sipán or depicted in other media, were worn on the belts of important male individuals, often at the front, back, and sides of the body.  With metal balls placed within each chamber, an assemblage of such adornments would have collectively made a shower of jingling tones enveloping the wearer with even the slightest move.  This bell is distinctive for the gourd shape of each chamber (most known examples consist of a series of simple spheres).",

Another work on the list, numbered P31 and P35, respectively in different versions, was exhibited and published in 1969, providing a terminus ante quem by which the proposed object was in the Tishman collection.\n\t<br />\n\t[2] As per letter from John L Tishman to private collection.
