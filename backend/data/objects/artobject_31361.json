A leading architect in Chicago during a period of great technological innovation, Sullivan embraced the modern, steel-framed skyscraper but covered his buildings with elaborate, richly organic ornament that seems to contradict its mechanical means of production. In this cast-iron baluster for the famed Schlesinger and Mayer department store in Chicago’s downtown Loop, Elmslie integrated Sullivan’s powerful style of decoration with the object’s intended function as both a screen and a support.\n",
