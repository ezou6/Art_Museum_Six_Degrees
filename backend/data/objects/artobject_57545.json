During an offering to deter impediments to having children he saw a painted portrait in elegant and special brushwork; [this was a portrait] of Zhang Xian. [It was said that] prayers [to this portrait] would be answered, so [Su Xun] exchanged a jade huan ring for it. Xun did not have children and everyday burned incense and prayed [to it]. After several years, he got [his sons] [Su] Shi and [Su] Zhe, both of whom were studious by nature. From this we know that the Immortal is eager to help and connect with people, and my words [prayers to Zhang Xian] to deter impediments to having children are not nonsense. For this reason, I record them from start to finish to let those in the future who want to pray for children and [so that after their prayers are also answered they] can add to these words of respect, words of their own. \r\nPraying on the shangyuan day [i.e., 15th day of 1st month] in the wuzi cyclical year of the Qingli reign. Su Xun from Ba [i.e., Sichuan], writes with bowed head.\r\nNotes:\r\n1.

We who lack virtue . . . have had difficulty in having sons . . . . I beg you partake of this sacrifice. Husband and wife will carry out the ritual of bowing four times, advance to the altar table with censers and light the incense, offer wine, read the prayer, and the bow four more times. The ritual of burning the prayer completed, use fine rice powder and roll them into pellets, color them in five colors, boil them together in a basin, [and also offer] three cups of tea, three small cups of wine, three cups of date soup, and a piece of deer breast. If without [deer breast] use mutton as a substitute for it. [Also offer] three seasonal fruits, but do not use qianma (votive money). Use the first third of the second months of spring or autumn to announce the day of the sacrifice. \r\n",

Zhang Xian is believed to protect children from this dog spirit with his bow and arrows. <br>Many prayed to him for male offspring and to protect their living children. In this rubbing, Zhang Xian sits outdoors on a seat made of rocks beside a tree. Behind him stands a boy holding his bow. In front at left, a youth offers a tray of food. Another youth holding a scepter stands at right looking down at two infants playing on the ground with a toad. Beyond the balustrade at rear, the Celestial Dog can be seen floating in the sky at upper right. <br></p><p>Above is a Su Xun 蘇洵 (1009-1066) two-part inscription composed in 1048. At top Su Xun tells how in1030 he traveled to the Yuju Guan monastery in Chengdu and saw a portrait of Zhang Xian that was said to efficacious in granting prayers for children. He traded a jade ornament for it and after several years of making offerings, his prayers were answered with the births of his sons Su Shi 蘇軾 (1036-1101) and Su Zhe 蘇轍 (or Su Che, 1039-1112). Below, written in smaller script, Su Xun outlines the offering ritual he followed so that others can benefit. <br></p>",
