The hawk in this painting is similar in appearance to hawks depicted in paintings by the great master Nainsukh (c. 1710-1778) of Guler. This may suggest that the painting was executed by one of his workshop followers or someone in his circle. It is also possible that this animal portrait derives from outside the Punjab Hills from the growing practice of naturalist paintings produced in the 18th and 19th centuries by Indian and Chinese artists working in India, sometimes for colonial patrons.&nbsp; A similar image of a parrot tethered to a stand was painted in the Patna area by Hulas Lal (c. 1785-1875) in about 1870.",
