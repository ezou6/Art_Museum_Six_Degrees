This image of the pyramids was made during one of Prince Albert’s stops along the Nile, which included climbing the Great Pyramid in the early morning to enjoy what he noted was “a fine view on the top.” Bedford’s photographs from this tour offer a landmark architectural and archaeological record for the time, not only in Egypt—which had seen increased travel from Europe after Napoleon’s invasion in 1798—but also in territories in the Ottoman Empire that were increasingly open to tourism, including Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and Greece.\n</p>",
