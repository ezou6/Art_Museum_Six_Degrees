Beginning in the early 1920s he restricted his painting primarily to still life compositions of bottles and utensils. Often posing the same vessels in varying groupings, Morandi explored neutral color hues and subtle tones to convey the vessels’ plasticity and three-dimensional presence. </P></SPAN>",

He deliberately restricted his subject matter and traveled little, perfecting his style in solitude. Still-life and, to a lesser degree, landscape were his subjects. This still-life, from the peak of Morandi’s career, demonstrates the subtle compositions and coloration of his best works. Taking utensils arranged in varying, concentrated groupings as motifs, he explored increasingly lighter, more neutral colors and the shadows conveying the plasticity of the vessels. His meditation on color and form—the elements of painting—and on making the objects \"present\" is nearly religious in intensity and purpose.</P></SPAN>",

He deliberately restricted travel and subject matter, perfecting his style in solitude. Still life and landscape were his favored themes, with few figural works.
