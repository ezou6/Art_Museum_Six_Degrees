Founded in New York in 1985, the group focuses on gender and racial discrimination in the art world. The underrepresentation of women artists in museums and galleries as well as in art criticism and textbooks is rampant, despite the fact that women have made up more than half of the graduating class of art schools for decades. This injustice is one the Guerrilla Girls seek to expose through their various projects, particularly the dozens of posters they have produced over the last twenty-seven years, all originally intended for public spaces. Incisive, hilarious, and polemical, these posters combine facts and arresting visual design. They read like PSAs, advertisements, or the kinds of charts one might use in a sales briefing, motivational speech, or training session, all formats the Guerrilla Girls repurpose for very different ends.</P></SPAN>",
