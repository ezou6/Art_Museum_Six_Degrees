Although she is pensive and at rest, the Countess has beside her on the table a large shuttle that attests to her industry and skill in fancy work. The instrument was used to make knotted lace, a forerunner of the tatted lace made with smaller shuttles by nineteenth- and twentieth-century ladies. </P></SPAN>",
