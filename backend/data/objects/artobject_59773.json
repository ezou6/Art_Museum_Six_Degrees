Spanning the upper façade of the former RKO General building at 43rd Street and 7th Avenue in New York, Katz’s 250-foot-long frieze incorporated dozens of portrait heads, each twenty feet tall, and combined art and advertising. The portrait seen here constitutes what the artist calls a cutout. Instead of the square or rectangle format that most painters favor, Katz used irregularly shaped pieces of aluminum cut to correspond to the silhouette of the figure depicted. His cutouts were usually placed on pedestals and displayed either on shelves or on floors. In creating works that were neither paintings nor sculptures, properly speaking, Katz challenged aesthetic convention. </P></SPAN>",

The sitter in this portrait is Susan Merians, a longtime Princeton resident; Katz created this image as a study of Merians for his monumental public artwork Nine Women (1977), a 247-foot-long billboard painting with portraits nearly 20 feet high that wrapped around the top of the RKO Building at Forty-Second Street and Seventh Avenue in New York. He commissioned a well-known sign painter to execute the massive piece. The project melded Katz’s interest in portraiture with his fascination with advertising as an omnipresent feature of the urban landscape.",
