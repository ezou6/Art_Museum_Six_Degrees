The rarely illustrated scene, from Exodus 18:13–23, is based on&nbsp;an illustration by the Lyon printmaker Bernard Salomon (ca.&nbsp;1508–1561) for Claude Paradin’s <I>Quadrins historiques de la Bible</I>, published in 1553; thus, the cup was painted later than the foot. Moses, enthroned in the camp of the Israelites as they wander in the desert, acts as judge for all disputes. Beside him, his father-in-law, Jethro, advises him to appoint additional judges to assist him in this task. The episode, which took place just before Moses received the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, was an important step in the founding of the Israelite polity.</P>\r\nLimoges enamel makers illustrated other scenes from the life of Moses, which suggests that the objects were destined for a Calvinist clientele for whom the Hebrew Bible furnished a model for their own community governance. Religious art was forbidden in Calvinist temples, but objects with figural decoration were allowed for domestic display in Calvinist homes, where subjects from the Hebrew Bible would have been instructive and inspired emulation. </P></SPAN>",

The grisaille (monochrome) decoration on the foot features grotesque ornament, originally inspired by the discovery of the wall decorations of Nero’s Golden House in Rome, and by this time a common decorative element in European art. The bowl’s interior shows a rarely illustrated episode from the Hebrew Bible. During their wanderings in the desert, the Israelites brought their disputes before Moses; his father-in-law Jethro counseled him to appoint judges instead. The scene, known as the “Judgment of Moses” or “Counsel of Jethro,” may have interested Calvinists as a model for their own church polity.",
