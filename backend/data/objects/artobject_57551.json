Today it is cut into obdurate stone and over numerous years will not lose its veracity. Recorded by the 46th generation descendant [or Confucius], the Court Gentleman of Manifest Virtue ,and Administrator of Xianyuan county in Yanzhou Kong Zongshou on the first day of the tenth month in the bingzi cyclical year or 2nd year of the Shaosheng reign.\r\n\r\nHe Xianjue 何先覺 (12th century)\r\n此畫在孔氏家廟，其來極遠貌像最為真絕。百世之後僊源紛擾，無復存焉。神物護持偶得家藏舊本。紹興甲戌[1154]上元日，左宜教郎、權知橫州軍州事何先覺重刋于寧浦郡學鄉貢進士、兖州學正甘彥摹。\r\nThis picture at the Kong family temple, its lofty appearance is truly matchless. After a hundred generations, the immortal [sage’s] origins will be in confusion and no longer survive. It is a wonder [that this picture] has been protected and maintained, and by chance to have obtained a copy from the family collection. On the 15th day of the jiaxu cyclical year of the Shaoxing reign, the . . . and Provisional Administrator of Hengzhou and Junzhou affairs He Xianjue recarved at the Ningpu prefectural school from a copy from Gan Yan, who was selected and recommended for the jinshi examinations and was the Instructor Second-class of Yanzhou. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1.

One of the disciples at top carries a qin-instrument over his shoulder and Confucius seems to clutch a long scepter or pipe under his left arm. The caption at top left labels this as a scene commemorating Confucius teaching students under an apricot tree; although, no tree is depicted. At left are two inscriptions. The one at right in four columns by Kong Zongshou, the 46th generation descendant of Confucius, relates that in 1095 he was responsible for carving into stone a painting of Confucius by the Tang dynasty artist Wu Daozi. The three-column inscription at left by He Xianjue records that the 1095 pictorial stone (at the Confucius Temple in Qufu, Shandong province) was recarved in 1154 at the prefectural school in Ningpu 寧浦 (present-day area of Hengxian 橫縣in Guangzhou廣州 province) based on a rubbing copy in the possession the official Gan Yan 甘彥. After the Princeton rubbing was made in the late 19th to first half of 20th century, the pictorial stone was lost until it was excavated in 1987 at Hengxian 横县, Guangzhou, showing signs of additional damage.
