His paintings were much admired by later artists, who often copied, referenced, or reinterpreted his landscape style—as was common in both painting and calligraphy when an earlier master’s talents were esteemed. Wang Fu discusses his admiration for Ni Zan—and the inspiration he drew from the particular visual language of Ni Zan's landscapes—in the painting’s inscription:</P>\r\n<P dir=ltr align=left>When I was a boy I once saw . . . a painting by Master Yi Nunlin [Ni Zan], Wutong Tree and Bamboo by a Thatched Pavilion. . . .
