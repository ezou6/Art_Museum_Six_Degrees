Field collectors for the great ethnographic museums of the east coast may have encouraged local Pueblo peoples to add figural ceramic forms to their&nbsp;repertoire of finely painted jars and bowls, objects that subsequently became very popular among tourists who started visiting Santa Fe via the rail line that was completed in 1880. The railroad also brought inspiration to local artists, who repre&shy;sented white tourists and traveling circus performers in clay. This two-headed, four armed, bearded figure, painted in the distinctive palette of Cochiti Pueblo potters, wears tights and a bandolier, suggesting a representation of such a newcomer to the region, possibly a specific sideshow or circus performer. Such objects were bought by avid col&shy;lectors who, seeking \"authentic Indian\" curios, were&nbsp;unknowingly acquiring Anglo caricatures. Given rich local traditions of clowning and humor, the irony was unlikely to have gone unnoticed by the Cochiti artists responsible for this work. </P></SPAN>",

Various artistic projects arose to document the supposedly doomed Native Americans, such as Inman’s painted catalogue of diverse Indigenous sitters, and later, in the commemorative mode of sculptural silhouette, Warner’s portrait medallions. Inman’s paintings depicted Native American leaders who travelled to Washington, DC, to negotiate territorial treaties, which were often disregarded by American lawmakers. Warner portrays Hin-Mah-Toó-Yah-Lat-Kekht in a medallion format often utilized to memorialize deceased subjects. Until just before the medallion was made, however, the chief was actively—and successfully—resisting capture by US armed forces seeking the removal of his people from ancestral lands. In an ironic reversal, a Cochiti Pueblo artist produced this humorous, two-headed likeness of a white newcomer to the Southwest, which was marketed to Anglo collectors seeking authentic “Indian” curios, and who thus unknowingly acquired caricatures of themselves.\n",
