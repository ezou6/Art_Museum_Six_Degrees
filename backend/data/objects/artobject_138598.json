Of the artist’s own invention, this domestic scene is based on a simple and crowd-pleasing plotline: angry parents burst into the bedroom of their daughter and discover her weeping in the corner after her lover has been found hiding in the large cupboard. Rumpled bedclothes reveal recent activity, while the yapping dog, puzzled children, and nosy neighbors provide a motley chorus—inviting us to join in as voyeurs.\n</p>",
