The painting presents a view across Northport Harbor, Long Island, at dawn. Less concerned with recording objective facts than evoking through abstract form nature’s fundamental forces, Dove employs concentric circles of bright white, yellow, and orange to convey the warmth and radiance of sunlight. A smaller set of circles appears to float on the water, suggesting the reflection of the sun or perhaps serving as an emblem for the artist, whose pictures similarly reflect and refract the world.  It could be that Dove, buoyed by the waves while painting shipboard, felt especially attuned to water and its properties, prompting him to register in his canvas his affinity with the ever-changing sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br /><b>\n\tRachael Z.

Completed in 1929, <I>Sunrise, Northport Harbor </I>depicts an area on Long Island’s North Shore favored by the artist, rendered in the vocabulary of swelling, curvilinear forms of modulating color then characteristic of his work, through which he sought to portray a nonautonomous perception of nature. The painting was exhibited at An American Place, the Manhattan gallery run by the photographer and influential promoter of American Modernism Alfred Stieglitz, who championed Dove’s work from the beginning of his career. </P></SPAN>",
