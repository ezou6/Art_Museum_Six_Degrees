He was first shot with arrows but miraculously survived; after he was healed, he was beaten to death. Arrows were traditionally associated with the bubonic plague, as contracting the disease was compared to being shot with an arrow. Thus, Sebastian was embraced as a protector against the plague and was frequently featured in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century European art as a figure of hope. This painting represents the saint both as a divine being in an abstract setting and as a victim with an arrow piercing his body where the plague’s pustules were known to appear. The suffering figure of Sebastian was later incorporated into twentieth-century works responding to the AIDS crisis, including one of David Wojnarowicz’s photomontages from his <em>Sex Series</em>, on view in this gallery.",
