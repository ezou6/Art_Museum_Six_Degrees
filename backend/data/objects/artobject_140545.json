The shafts are inscribed in Hebrew with a date, making these among the earliest dated Moroccan finials. Unusually, they were dedicated by a woman, who is praised by citing a biblical passage: “These <i>rimmonim </i>for the Torah scroll were dedicated by the honorable and modest Mrs. Simcha, ‘blessed of all women in the tent’ (Judges 5:24), in [memory] of her husband the Rabbi Yosef Abitbul, may he rest in Eden, who passed onto his eternal rest on the fourth of Shevat, 5611 [1851 CE], May his soul be bound up in the bond of life.”\n",
