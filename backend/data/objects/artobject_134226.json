Roche was among the few battlefield photographers to remain near the Petersburg, Virginia, front during the last days of the Civil War, producing one of the most extensive series of battlefield views. Many of his photographs are stereographs, a format that places two images taken at slightly different angles side by side on a single card. When viewed through a binocular device called a stereoscope, the two images coalesce into one, producing an illusion of three-dimensionality. Widely distributed to convey narratives related to the recent war, these stereographs serve as examples of photography’s role as a tool of mass communication.</p><p>This image shows the route into the trenches and the body of a Confederate soldier. Further in the distance is another soldier, his body barely visible. Roche may have rearranged the body in the foreground to mimic the lines of the wooden barricade in the lower right corner, thus enhancing the scene’s sense of depth. This arrangement would help this photograph seem to come alive in three dimensions when placed in a stereo viewer, a binocular device that would cause the two images on the card, taken at slightly different angles, to coalesce into a single frame. The position of the soldier’s body obscures his face from the viewer, and his anonymity may serve as a symbol for the countless lives that perished in the war.<br></p>",
