Relying solely on found material, Rosler inserted images of war into depictions of otherwise placid domestic interiors and then photographed the results. The juxtapositions are scaled so as to appear seamless, but this only heightens the works’ cognitive dissonance, as public and private, militarism and eroticism, East and West collide. Rosler’s series also lampoons the rabid consumerism of the 1960s, promoted in precisely the sort of lifestyle magazines sampled here. Initially, Rosler distributed <EM>Bringing the War Home</EM> in leaflets and broadsheets at anti-war demonstrations and reproduced them in left-wing newspapers. </P></SPAN>",
