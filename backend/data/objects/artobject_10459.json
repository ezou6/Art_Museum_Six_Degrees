In this composition, Susanna appears twice: in the foreground, raising her arms in praise of God; and in the background, where she is shown bathing in a pool while accosted by two elders, who threaten to accuse her of adultery (a crime punishable by death) unless she sleeps with them. Refusing to do so, she is later arrested on the false testimony of the elders but is proved innocent by Daniel, who cross-examines the men and exposes them as liars, whereupon they are stoned to death.",
