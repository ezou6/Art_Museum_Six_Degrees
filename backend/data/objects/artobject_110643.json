            "textentryhtml":"Two sheets by Utagawa Kunisada (a multicolor actor print and its key block proof print)<br>The prints are an unusual example of a finished print and the key block proof print used to produce it, and it is this combination that convinced the students to recommend them. The finished print is a representative example of a type for which Kunisada was well known: a bust-length portrait of a famous actor. It is in pristine condition, the colors are bright and well preserved, the composition is dramatically bold, and the impression is excellent. It employs some of the most technically advanced and difficult printing techniques then available, for which the best Kunisada prints are known, including overprinting of colors for subtle tonal effects, the use of mica, and blind printing to create intricate textures. The pair is unusual in that it includes the key block proof print. Proof prints were used in the production of a multi-color woodblock print: each color in a print required a separate woodblock, and so proof prints, comprising only the black outlines of the design, were pasted onto blocks to guide the carver; in this process, proof prints were destroyed. The example is a rare (though not unknown) survivor, and it is especially unusual to have an opportunity to purchase the proof print and finished print together. Sebastian Izzard found them separately, and made them available to us as a pair. Together the pair would be an effective teaching tool to help explain the technical aspects of printmaking, both in class and in exhibitions for museum visitors. The students noted, too, in their examination of the prints that even the type of paper used was different for the proof print and finished print, the former very thin to allow for easier carving and the latter quite thick, typical of Kunisada’s deluxe prints.",
