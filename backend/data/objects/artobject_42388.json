            "textentryhtml":"\r\nDavid Smith consistently violated deeply entrenched sculptural conventions throughout his career. Influenced by his employment in an automobile factory as well as by his exposure to the welded-iron sculptures of Pablo Picasso and Julio González, Smith was one of the first artists to employ welded steel, a material associated with blue-collar labor, not fine art. He also borrowed elements from the genres of painting and collage, embellishing his sculptures with pigment and assembling works out of disparate, often ready-made scraps and objects.</P><I>\r\nPainted Landscape (The Love Letter)</I> reflects Smith’s dual interests in painting and sculpture, flatness and depth. The work is just barely three-&shy;dimensional, and it begs to be read from the front, as a picture plane. Lacking the mass and solidity of traditional sculpture, it depends instead on an open lattice of attenuated forms that resemble a kind of drawing in space. The sculpture also invites decryption: a humanoid figure serves as the sculpture’s \"trunk,\" and from its six branches Smith attached a number of ambiguous glyphs, including the eponymous love letter, indicated by the incisions made to a flat piece of ruddy steel. </P></SPAN>",

With its glyphic forms and curved branches, Painted Landscape recalls sculptural calligraphy. Smith worked as a painter before turning his focus to sculpture. Negotiating the planar language of painting and the spatial language of sculpture remained important to him throughout his career; he described his sculptural practice as “drawings in space.”",
