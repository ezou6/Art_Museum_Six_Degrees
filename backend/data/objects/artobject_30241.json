Following exposure to European abstraction, however, he began to acquire modernist art, amassing an important collection that was displayed in his Gallery of Living Art at New York University, which opened in 1927 as the first American museum devoted exclusively to modern art. Gallatin himself took up painting seriously in 1936, evolving a style informed by the artists he collected, particularly the Cubists Juan Gris (1887–1927), Pablo Picasso (1881–1973), and Fernand Léger (1881–1955). <i>The Wine Glass</i>, a typically austere image in the subtle and refined palette Gallatin favored, was completed in 1945, three years after he made his public debut as a painter in his renamed Museum of Living Art, along with other members of the New York–based American Abstract Artists.\n",
