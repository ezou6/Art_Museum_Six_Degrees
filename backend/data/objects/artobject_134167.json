            "textentryhtml":"<p>Jan Both left his native Netherlands to spend several years in Rome (ca. 1638–41). While there, he sketched landscapes from nature that would serve as inspiration for the Italianate views marked by golden light and warm atmosphere that he painted back in Utrecht. This landscape features one of the artist’s favorite subjects: the Ponte Lucano and the Tomb of the Plautii, Roman monuments in the vicinity of Tivoli that here have been relocated to a more mountainous terrain marked by massive trees. The figure of a driver with his mule is also a recurring motif in Both’s work. Extremely popular, the artist’s paintings were widely imitated and copied. The concentration of forms on one side of the picture, the relatively tight brushwork, and the compact shape of the central tree in this work are characteristic of the type of composition Both painted in the first half of the 1640s. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
