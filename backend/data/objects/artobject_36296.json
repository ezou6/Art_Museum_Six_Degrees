Similar qualities enliven these letters that display brushwork differences reflecting the circumstances under which they were written. The calligraphy of <em>Abundant Harvest</em>, which recounts the artist’s good fortune during a time of peace and prosperity, was written at a leisurely pace, with smooth, elegant turns of the brush. In<em> Escaping Summer Heat</em>, Mi, using more angular brushwork with slightly misshapen characters, reported his satisfaction at spending summer in the cool mountains, while omitting mention of his refusal to collect taxes after a bad harvest. The impetuous, more cursive brushwork of <em>Hasty Reply before Guests</em> seems to reflect the artist’s unease about eluding a visit from a court official sent to investigate his management of district affairs.",
