All but two hold a strawberry plant, whose red, almost heart-shaped fruit perhaps connotes love. Because young boys and girls were dressed similarly in the nineteenth century, it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the sex of a child in a portrait, although accompanying accoutrements can provide clues, establishing gender roles often at the expense of women and their social agency. The boy in Boy in Red holds a utilitarian toy hammer positioned before him like a displaced phallus, suggesting his future role as creator and builder. The painting’s cognate, Girl in Pink, represents a girl wearing a coral teething necklace and displaying a piece of fruit in front of her womb, symbolizing her eventual fertility.\n",
