The term <i>mvet </i>encompasses not only a type of instrument but also an expansive art form including dances, mimicry, chants, and recited poems. Similarly, Adkins conceived of his practice as multidisciplinary, understanding his works as compositions and describing them as “a way to make music as physical as sculpture might be and sculpture as ethereal as music is.”",
