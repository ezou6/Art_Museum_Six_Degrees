He hired nine printmakers to help him produce a portrait series, later called the <I>Iconography</I>, that included images of several contemporary artists as well as kings, aristocrats, and diplomats. Published after his death in numerous editions, the highly influential series consisted of around one hundred prints, of which the artist etched only fifteen, including this lively portrait of his compatriot Justus Sustermans, who became court artist to the Medici Grand Dukes of Tuscany. </P></SPAN>",
