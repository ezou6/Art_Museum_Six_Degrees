Both before and after her marriage in 1825, she produced watercolor portraits of her family and friends, offering them as gifts. According to Taber’s inscription on the verso, this engaging large-scale portrait of her niece Mehitable Eddy Taber, nicknamed Hetty, was made on May 29, 1830, when the sitter was thirteen months old. With the exception of a few strokes of watercolor on the face, wrist, and elbow, the artist relied primarily on the paper support to suggest flesh tones. </P></SPAN>",
