At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he was drafted into the army, but within months he suffered a nervous breakdown and lung problems, leading to his discharge. He began treatment in late 1915 at a sanatorium in Königstein, run by the neurologist and psychiatrist Dr. Oskar Kohnstamm, and located in the Taunus Mountains near Frankfurt. Upon arrival, Kirchner wrote that in Königstein he hoped to find “something new . . . peace and absolute seclusion.” During his three stays there, he created a series of landscapes—including this lithograph—that suggest a primordial contact with nature, inspired by the majestic fir trees in the nearby forests.",

In the spring of 1915, with Germany embroiled in war, Kirchner enlisted as an artillery driver to avoid conscription; within months, the onset of lung problems and a mental health crisis led to his provisional discharge. That December, he began treatment at a sanatorium in Königstein in the Taunus Mountains near Frankfurt, where he said he sought “peace and absolute seclusion,” although the threat of being called back into service caused constant anxiety. During three stays at Königstein he created landscapes of the nearby forests and mountains such as this one. The pictures’ idyllic settings reflect the tension between convalescence and unrest that characterized the artist’s rehabilitation.\n",
