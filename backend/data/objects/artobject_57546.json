            "textentryhtml":"Portrait of Budai, a Buddhist monk who is said to be an incarnation of Maitreya, the future Buddha. In this rubbing he is shown as a bald portly man with a sad grimace on his downcast face. Wearing a robe open to his round belly, he moves to the left with his left arm outstretched while over his right shoulder he carryies a wood staff and on his back is a large “cloth sack” (budai 布袋) that holds his few worldly possessions. Though poor, Budai is content, and in later times he is often depicted laughing and happy. As a result he came to be known as the “Laughing Buddha” (xiaofo 笑佛), but here he is seen with a grimace, which may indicate that this is an early image of the monk before later representations of him with a happy persona became standardized. Above is an 1088 inscription with the signature of the Song dynasty literatus, statesman, and artist Su Shi 蘇軾 (1036-1101), who attributes the portrait to Cui Bo (11th century). The calligraphy of the inscription, however, does not seem to be written in the manner of Su Shi. ",
