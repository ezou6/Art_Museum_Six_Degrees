Caught in a rainstorm, he borrowed a farmer’s bamboo hat and clogs before continuing on his way, while the villagers laughed at the sight of his outlandish appearance. The pictorial stone that was the base for this rubbing is said to follow a painting by the Ming dynasty artist Qiu Ying. The stone was carved in 1862 through the agency of Feng Xun for the Wild Goose in Snow Pavilion (Hongxue Xuan 鴻雪軒) in Wucheng 吳城 town, Yongxiu 永修 county, Jiangxi province (in present-day Xinjina新建县 county). The hall was built by the Qing dynasty official Wu Kunxiu 吳坤修 (1816-1872) and was named after verses in a Su Shi poem:</p><p>&nbsp; To what should we compare human life?<br>&nbsp; It should be compared to a wild goose trampling on the snow.<br>&nbsp; The snow retains for a moment the imprint of its feet;<br>&nbsp; the goose flies away no one knows where.<br>&nbsp; (trans.
