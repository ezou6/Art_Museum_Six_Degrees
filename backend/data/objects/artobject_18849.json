According to legend, in the winter of 1142, Princess Matilda (also known as Empress Maud), the daughter of King Henry I and sole legitimate heir to the English throne, had been besieged in Oxford Castle by her French-born cousin, who believed that a woman could not rule. Fleeing one December night across the frozen River Thames, the Empress escaped undetected against the snow and ice by wearing only her white nightdress. Following her cousin’s death in 1154 the crown passed to Matilda’s eldest son, who became King Henry II, the first of the Plantagenet kings to rule England.",
