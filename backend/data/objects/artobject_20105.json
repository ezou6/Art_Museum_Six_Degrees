But in these paintings, Chardin elevates humble subject matter into reflections on the acts of painting and observation, thereby signaling the intellectual value of still life painting. In <i>Attributes of the Painter</i>, Chardin introduces objects that highlight painting’s materiality: the artist’s palette with dabs of paint and two small pig-bladder containers used to store additional pigments. In <i>Attributes of the Architect</i>, the artist presents the tools of draftsmanship, which appear startingly naturalistic from a distance but become less legible beneath his flurry of strokes when viewed up close.\n",

            "textentryhtml":"\r\nChardin practiced an art form that, by tradition, was not of a high rank: in the academic hierarchy, still life was placed lower than history painting, portraiture, genre scenes, or even animal painting. Parisian by birth and at first apprenticed to history painters, Chardin found a vocation in the humble genre of still-life painting, although he also painted figural scenes of contemporary life, combining children or kitchen maids with still-life elements. As Chardin rose from shop-sign painter to member of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture (where he was admitted to the ranks as a painter of still life in 1728), he gained the admiration of artists and collectors, and even the art critic Denis Diderot, who considered him a genius. These paintings, probably a pair of overdoors for a small study, testify to Chardin’s preternatural powers of observation and ability to render different substances in paint. They also are moral portraits of the owners of the tools, the artist and the architect. It has been noted that the dabs of paint on the palette are the colors used in the painting, as if the artist were providing a glimpse of his working practice. <I>Attributes of the Painter</I> includes a further wry, self-referential element in the small sculpture, which Jennifer Montagu has identified as a model by François Duquesnoy for the executioner holding up the head of John the Baptist in a sculpted tableau of the martyrdom of Chardin’s patron saint. </P></SPAN>",
