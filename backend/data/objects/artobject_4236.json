Throughout much of his career he praised monarchs as patrons of the arts, yet in his final years he feared political violence over the failure of the British government to provide Catholic emancipation following the Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland in 1800. In this drawing, a king—aided by an Anglican bishop—unfurls twin banners, reading \"Passive Obedience\" and \"Divine Right,\" while a virtuous figure supported by an angel recoils from the chaos and corruption that surrounds him.</P></SPAN>",
