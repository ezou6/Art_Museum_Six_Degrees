Cole was a founding member of the National Academy, as well as the initiator of the Hudson River School, and his influence as a landscape painter and draftsman extended over several generations of American artists, writers, and collectors. Cole would undertake arduous sketching expeditions throughout remote wilderness areas of the Hudson Valley and New England, making meticulous graphite drawings to be used as reference material for paintings he later produced in the studio. This close study of rocks and trees was most likely made on an excursion Cole took to the Adirondacks in the summer of 1846. </P>\r\n</P></SPAN>",
