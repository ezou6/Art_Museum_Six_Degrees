Xianzao Ting 仙棗亭 (Pavilion of the immortal date) is also known as Lüxian Ting 呂仙亭 (Pavilion of the immortal Lü). It was built during the early Ming dynasty atop Snake Mountain (She shan 蛇山), Wuchang 武昌, Hunan province. In 1993 it was rebuilt near Huanghe Lou 黃鶴樓. There are stories of that there used to be date trees at this location that did bear fruit. A pavilion named “Hoping for dates” (pan zao 盼枣) was built. The next year the trees produced large dates that if eaten were believed to lead to immortality. The official sent guards and prepared a feast for himself, but the page-boy he had sent to pick the dates did not return. When they went to check on him, they discovered that he had eaten a date and already become immortal, and all the remaining fruit had fallen to the ground and became stone.

The large date refers to the Pavilion of the Immortal Date (Xianzao Ting 仙棗亭), which marked an area where unfruitful date trees suddenly produced&nbsp; miraculously large dates that resulted in immortality if eaten. The two round coins with square openings symbolizes immortal enlightenment. Beneath the seal-script title across the top is inscribed the “Precious Admonitions of Patriarch Lu” 呂祖寶誥 as transcribed by Guanwen 官文 (1798-1871), a Manchu bondservant, general, and official. At left is an 1864 inscription by Wang Jie describes some of the symbols in the portrait and records that he had the pictorial stone from which this rubbing was taken carved after having rebuilt the Pavilion. The name of the stone carver is also inscribed at bottom right and an inscription dated 1867 appears at lower right. The figure is carved in outline so that in the rubbing the face, hands, and feet, along with other infill areas including the large date and background all appear in black.",
