As amateur astronomers themselves, Nasmyth and Carpenter formulated ideas about how the moon’s topography formed, and in 1874 they published <em>The Moon: Considered as a Planet, a World, and a Satellite</em>, one of the first books illustrated by photomechanical prints. Unlike earlier images of the earth’s satellite, Nasmyth and Carpenter’s moonscapes were created with small plaster models that measured about twenty inches in diameter. Despite this fiction, the publication was warmly received by scientists for its high-fidelity images of the lunar models and its accessibility to the public.",
