He was called to the seminary in Princeton, where his reputation as a teacher and theologian — and his popularity as an after-dinner speaker — grew rapidly. Even those who disagreed with his rigid, conservative Presbyterian views admired his intellect and wit. </P>\r\n<P>His election as McCosh’s successor did not meet with unanimous enthusiasm. Many had hoped not only for a devout educator, but also for an experienced administrator who would bring efficiency to the expanding College. </P>\r\n<P>Faculty accounts indicate that Patton lacked initiative in important policy matters, resisted meaningful curriculum reform, and was lax in matters of discipline and scholarly standards — in short, as one colleague said kindly, he was “a wonderfully poor administrator.” But students of the 1890s were unanimous in their affection for him. </P>\r\n<P>In the fall of 1896, Patton proclaimed a three-day holiday to celebrate the Sesquicentennial of the College and to confirm its new official name, Princeton University. In the process, he changed the wording of the seal from <EM>Collegii Neo-Caesariensis</EM> to <EM>Universitatis Princetoniensis</EM>, retaining the open Bible at the center and returning to the ancient motto: <EM>Dei sub numine viget</EM> (Under God’s power she flourishes). <BR></P>",
