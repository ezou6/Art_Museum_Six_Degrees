Following his studies at the Dresden Academy, the artist traveled to Florence and Rome.

By the fifteenth century the conception of the Ark as floating upon a flood that engulfs the unfaithful had become symbolic of the strength and safety of the Church itself. In the first of these two drawings, following God’s command, Noah leads his family and the animals into the newly built Ark, leaving the old world to its fate. In the second, having survived the flood, Noah and his family offer sacrifice to God, in thanks for having led them into a world reborn. </P>\r\n<P>Calvin Brown, Associate Curator of Prints and Drawings, Princeton University Art Museum<BR></P>",
