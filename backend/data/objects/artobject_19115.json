Molds could be used to make multiple iterations of the same object, as seen with the mold for a fish amulet, while small models offered a physical example of an individual, object, or animal that could be replicated by numerous craftsmen at once. Some of these are more schematic, offering only a rough approximation of a form, while others are more precise, such as the model for the head of a pharaoh, which features the proper proportions, marked out on a grid, on the back of the head. There also survive examples of practice, where similar animals or bodies were repeatedly carved into stone as their makers perfected their technique.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n</p>",

Very little is known of Imhotep as a historical figure, but in the centuries following his death he was gradually glorified as a scribe, counselor, doctor, priest, and astronomer, and eventually worshipped as a god of architecture and medicine. In art he is usually depicted seated and holding a scroll, perhaps recording a healing potion or spell.",
