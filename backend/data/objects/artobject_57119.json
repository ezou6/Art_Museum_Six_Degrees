            "textentryhtml":"This work by Irish artist Tom Molloy is the first in a series of drawings based on the x-ray of a dove. For some, the dove is nothing more than a trite, empty sign, one that is evocative of the failed idealism of the Sixties more than the principles of peace and reconciliation. Molloy manages, however to retrieve from this exhausted symbol an image that is both breathtaking and heartbreaking. With its outstretched wings and extended neck, Molloy’s dove seems victimized as much as it does ecstatic, and its pose oddly recalls both the crucifixion of Christ and the ecstasy of Saint Teresa. Dove (X-ray) is a poetic meditation on the protracted conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, and elsewhere, conflicts that suffocate hope and imperil life. Yet its aching beauty might also anticipate a future beyond war and violence.",
