            "textentryhtml":"Born in Edinburgh, David Roberts began his career as a designer of stage sets and panoramas and later became a successful topographical painter and draftsman, specializing in architectural subjects from continental Europe. Expanding his horizons, in 1838 Roberts embarked on an extensive tour of Egypt, Nubia, and the Holy Land, becoming one of the first British artists to faithfully record the Near East firsthand, in a series of over two hundred meticulous drawings and watercolors. Upon his return to London in 1839, with the encouragement of such notable sponsors as Queen Victoria, Roberts engaged the skilled Belgian lithographer Louis Haghe to reproduce these watercolors in a series of six folio-sized volumes published between 1842 and 1849. The lithographs were an immediate international sensation, with more than 2,000 copies sold by advance subscription.",
