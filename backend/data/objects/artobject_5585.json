Dwarfs frequently appear in ancient Maya art, as they were common and important members of royal courts. Some scholars have suggested that their especially close relationship to Maya kings had mythological roots. Kings considered themselves akin to the beautiful maize god, whose long, slender head mimicked that of the single well-formed ear of corn a plant typically produces; other ears on the plant tend to be smaller and not fully developed. By analogy, people with achondroplasia were thought to be “of the same stalk” as royalty. </P>",

            "textentryhtml":"<P>The recent gift of an intriguing Maya figurine from Gillett G. Griffin adds significantly to the Museum's superlative holdings of Jaina-style ceramic portraits. This figure's stout, broad physiognomy and distinctive facial features, including a flat nose and large head, indicate a naturalistic and sensitive rendition of achondroplasia, a genetic mutation that is among the most common causes of dwarfism.</P>\r\n<P>Dwarfs are frequently depicted in ancient Maya art, as ceramic figurines, in historical scenes on monumental sculpture, and on cylinder vases, where they appear in the company of royalty. Such scenes imply that dwarfs were common members of royal courts, where their primary role was likely as court jester. </P>\r\n<P>This particular dwarf dons a costume similar to those worn by elite Maya warriors, including a thick, un-spun cotton scarf and wristbands, an elaborate bird headdress, and sizable jade ear ornaments. The tubular shaft of clay that helps the figure stand upright also serves as the blow-hole for a whistle; the work's high-pitched shrill likely evokes the cacophonous mayhem of melee battle. A surprising detail is the inclusion of a small maskette at the forehead, which mimics the dwarfs' visage below; surely a humorous aspect of the work, this maskette indicates that the depicted individual may be impersonating a dwarf who is impersonating a noble lord. </P>\r\n<P>Among many Maya groups in Guatemala and southeastern Mexico, legends speak of small clay dwarfs that inhabit forests. Some stories suggest these dwarfs linger from a previous creation of the world and maintain supernatural vision not granted to humans of the current creation. Additionally, Yucatec Maya legends suggest that the <EM>alux</EM>, a forest-dwelling dwarf made from clay - or, in other accounts, the color of clay - can either cause mischief to those who trespass on archaeological sites (especially at night), or, if properly fed and appeased, will guard such sites or one's maize fields from trespassers. In Yucatec Maya, the term <I>k'at</I> means both \"dwarf\" and \"potter's clay,\" further linking ancient figurines of dwarfs with modern myths of forest-dwelling, super-powered dwarfs. <BR><BR><EM>Bryan Just</EM> Peter Jay Sharp, Class of 1952, Curator and Lecturer, Art of the Ancient Americas</P>",
