Usually I was never much interested in explaining what I was doing. The doing was important, whether to note ideas and thoughts, or to make an object or other work such as an environment or performance, mainly to give the idea some kind of form in order to see what that would be like. Sometimes in the making I was surprised at the results; other times the making led to new realizations of even greater import for me as though the original idea was only a hint of what was forming within.”",
