Inspired by the example of Song Yu, who described a goddess to the king of Chu, I eventually composed a rhapsody which read: \r\nLeaving the capital \r\nTo return to my fief in the east, \r\nYi Barrier at my back, \r\nUp over Huanyuan, \r\nPassing through Tong Valley, \r\nCrossing Mount Jing; \r\nThe sun had already dipped in the west, \r\nThe carriage unsteady, the horses fatigued, \r\nAnd so I halted my rig in the spikenard marshes, \r\nGrazed my team of four at Lichen Fields, \r\nIdling a while by Willow Wood, \r\nLetting my eyes wander over the Luo \r\nThen my mood seemed to change, my spirit grew restless; \r\nSuddenly my thoughts had scattered \r\nI looked down, hardly noticing what was there, \r\nLooked up to see a different sight, \r\nTo spy a lovely lady by the slopes of the riverbank. \r\nI took hold of the coachman's arm and asked, “Can you see her? Who could she be—a woman so beautiful!” The coachman replied, “I have heard of the goddess of the River Luo, whose name is Fufei. What you see, my prince—is it not she? But what does she look like? I beg you to tell me!” \r\nAnd I answered: \r\n\r\nHer body soars lightly like a startled swan, \r\nGracefully, like a dragon in flight, \r\nIn splendor brighter than the autumn chrysanthemum, \r\nIn bloom more flourishing than the pine in spring; \r\nDim as the moon mantled in filmy clouds, \r\nRestless as snow whirled by the driving wind \r\nGaze far off from a distance: \r\nShe sparkles like the sun rising from morning mists; \r\nPress closer to examine: \r\nShe flames like the lotus flower topping the green wave \r\nShe strikes a balance between plump and frail; \r\nThe tall and short of her are justly proportioned, \r\nWith shoulders shaped as if by carving, \r\nWaist narrow as though bound with white cords; \r\nAt her slim throat and curving neck \r\nThe pale flesh lies open to view, \r\nNo scented ointments overlaying it, \r\nNo coat of leaden powder applied. \r\nCloud-bank coiffure rising steeply, \r\nLong eyebrows delicately arched, \r\nRed lips that shed their light abroad, \r\nWhite teeth gleaming within, \r\nBright eyes skilled at glances, \r\nA dimple to round off the base of the cheek— \r\nHer rare form wonderfully enchanting, \r\nHer manner quiet, her pose demure. \r\nGentle-hearted, broad of mind, \r\nShe entrances with every word she speaks; \r\nHer robes are of a strangeness seldom seen, \r\nHer face and figure live up to her paintings. \r\nWrapped in the soft rustle of silken garments, \r\nShe decks herself with flowery earrings of jasper and jade, \r\nGold and kingfisher hairpins adorning her head, \r\nStrings of bright pearls to make her body shine \r\nShe treads in figured slippers fashioned for distant wandering, \r\nAiry trains of mistlike gauze in tow, \r\nDimmed by the odorous haze of unseen orchids, \r\nPacing uncertainly beside the corner of the hill. \r\nThen suddenly she puts on a freer air, \r\nReady for rambling, for pleasant diversion. \r\nTo the left planting her colored pennants, \r\nTo the right spreading the shade of cassia flags, \r\nShe dips pale wrists into the holy river's brink, \r\nPlucks dark iris from the rippling shallows \r\nMy fancy is charmed by her modest beauty, \r\nBut my heart, uneasy, stirs with distress: \r\nWithout a skilled go-between to join us in bliss, \r\nI must trust these little waves to bear my message \r\nDesiring that my sincerity first of all be known, \r\nI undo a girdle-jade to offer as pledge. \r\nAh, the pure trust of that lovely lady, \r\nTrained in ritual, acquainted with the Songs; \r\nShe holds up a garnet stone to match my gift, \r\nPointing down into the depths to show where we should meet. \r\nClinging to a lover's passionate faith, \r\nYet I fear that this spirit may deceive me; \r\nWarned by tales of how Jiaofu was abandoned, \r\nI pause, uncertain and despairing; \r\nThen, stilling such thoughts, I turn a gentler face toward her, \r\nSignaling that for my part I abide by the rules of ritual \r\nThe spirit of the Luo, moved by my action, \r\nPaces to and fro uncertainly, \r\nThe holy light deserting her, then reappearing, \r\nNow darkening, now shining again; \r\nShe lifts her light body in the posture of a crane, \r\nAs though about to fly but not yet taking wing. \r\nShe walks the heady perfume of pepper-scented roads, \r\nStrides through clumps of spikenard, scattering their fragrance. \r\nWailing distractedly, a sign of endless longing, \r\nHer voice, sharp with sorrow, growing more prolonged. \r\nThen a swarm of milling spirits appears, \r\nCalling companions, whistling to their mates, \r\nSome sporting in the clear current, \r\nSome hovering over sacred isles, \r\nSome searching for bright pearls, \r\nSome collecting kingfisher plumes. \r\nThe goddess attends the two queens of Xiang in the south, \r\nJoins hands with Wandering Girl from the banks of the Han, \r\nSighs that the Gourd Star has no spouse, \r\nLaments that the Herdboy must live alone. \r\nLifting the rare fabric of her thin jacket, \r\nShe makes a shield of her long sleeve, pausing in hesitation, \r\nBody nimbler than a winging duck, \r\nSwift, as befits the spirit she is; \r\nTraversing the waves in tiny steps, \r\nHer gauze slippers seem to stir a dust \r\nHer movements have no constant pattern, \r\nNow unsteady, now sedate; \r\nHard to predict are her starts and hesitations, \r\nNow advancing, now turning back. \r\nHer roving glance flashes fire; \r\nA radiant warmth shines from her jadelike face \r\nHer words, held back, remain unvoiced, \r\nHer breath scented as though with hidden orchids; \r\nHer fair face all loveliness— \r\nShe makes me forget my hunger! \r\nThen the god Bingyi calls in his winds, \r\nThe River Lord stills the waves, \r\nWhile Pingyi beats a drum, \r\nAnd Nu Wa offers simple songs \r\nSpeckled fish are sent aloft to clear the way for her carriage, \r\nJade bells are jangled for accompaniment; \r\nSix dragon-steeds, solemn, pulling neck to neck, \r\nShe rides the swift passage of her cloudy chariot. \r\nWhales dance at the hubs on either side, \r\nWater birds flying in front to be her guard. \r\nAnd when she has gone beyond the northern sandbars, \r\nWhen she has crossed the southern ridges, \r\nShe bends her white neck, \r\nClear eyes cast down, \r\nMoves her red lips, \r\nSpeaking slowly; \r\nDiscussing the great principles that govern friendship, \r\nShe complains that men and gods must follow separate ways, \r\nVoices anger that we cannot fulfill the hopes of youth, \r\nHolding up her gauze sleeve to hide her weeping, \r\nTorrents of teardrops drowning her lapels \r\nShe laments that our happy meeting must end forever, \r\nGrieves that, once separated, we go to different lands \r\n “No way to express my unworthy love, \r\n I give you this bright earring from south of the Yangtze. \r\n Though I dwell in the Great Shadow down under the waters, \r\n My heart will forever belong to you, my prince!” \r\nThen suddenly I could not tell where she had gone; \r\nTo my sorrow the spirit vanished in darkness, veiling her light. \r\nWith this I turned my back on the lowland, climbed the height; \r\nMy feet went forward but my soul remained behind \r\nThoughts taken up with the memory of her image, \r\nI turned to look back, a heart full of despair. \r\nHoping that the spirit form might show itself again, \r\nI embarked in a small boat to journey upstream, \r\nDrifting over the long river, forgetting to return, \r\nWrapped in endless remembrances that made my longing greater \r\nNight found me fretful, unable to sleep; \r\nHeavy frosts soaked me until the break of day \r\nI ordered the groom to ready the carriage, \r\nThinking to return to my eastern road, \r\nBut though I seized the reins and lifted up my whip, \r\nI stayed lost in hesitation and could not break away.\r\nhttps://www.poetrynook.com/poem/goddess-luo \r\n\r\nLeft, bottom:\r\n[need better image]\r\n。。。任子[1852]八月。。。",
