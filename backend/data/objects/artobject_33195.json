Only the upper arms, thighs, and torso of a player could strike the ball, and each of these areas bore its own type of protection, made of cloth, deer hide, or wood. Heavy stone replicas of ball game gear likely served as trophies for the victors in noble bouts of the game. Frequently made of precious greenstone, such replicas also may have been created as works of art to be wagered, as gambling was a significant component of Mesoamerican ball games. Some sculptures include elaborate relief carving, often portraying bruised and battered individuals, who may represent captives forced to play the game as a form of ritual sacrifice. Others portray identical youthful faces, possibly mythical hero twins who played the ball game against the lords of the underworld. Other stone objects may have been used in a ball game to hit the ball or to strike fellow combatants in ritualized fights. </P>",

            "textentryhtml":"Although the ballgame was played throughout Mexico and Central America, no region gave it more artistic attention than Veracruz, not surprisingly, as the rubber-tree sap used to make the balls is prevalent in the humid tropical lowlands along the coast. Most regional variants of the game shared several basic features: the use of a solid rubber ball, a ballcourt consisting of a narrow alleyway with sloped walls, sometimes with enclosed end zones, and two teams of two or three members who wore specialized protective gear. Only the upper arms, thighs, and torso could strike the ball, and each of these areas bore its own type of protection made of cloth, leather, or wood. \r\n\tThis heavy stone sculpture is a ceremonial replica of a hip guard, known today as a \"yoke.\" Such fine stone yokes likely served as trophies for the victors in noble bouts of the ballgame. Typical of carved yokes from Veracruz, this example portrays in shallow relief a highly stylized human figure with a frontal head at the center of the outer surface of the U-shape; identical faces appear on the lateral sides. The facial distortion, with one eye swollen, mouth shifted awkwardly to one side, and tongue lolling, is referred to by the Spanish word tuerto, meaning someone blind in one eye. Scrollwork in characteristic Veracruz style embellishes the interstices of the yoke, and its ends are adorned with fanged serpent heads.\r\n",
