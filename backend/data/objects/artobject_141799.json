The artist’s early athletic talent led to a successful career in modern dance, which eventually gave her the means to purchase a camera. Lepkoff’s upbringing in the city and her training as a dancer influenced her photographic interest in the motion of everyday urban spaces. In <i>Urban Rhythm</i>, a young woman moves gracefully across the pavement of a Midtown street, her motion captured as a blur by the camera lens and her hair rising up behind her, echoing the steam escaping from the surrounding manholes.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br />\n</p>",
