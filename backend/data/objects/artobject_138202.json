            "textentryhtml":"Silhouetted swimmers move across the three panels of <em>Moments in Blue</em>, their bodies distorted by the crests and troughs of an undulating surface whose form derives from patterns in brain-wave data, rendered by an EEG (electroencephalogram) and gathered from research conducted in this very building. The three panels present three topographic maps of the brain responding to the introduction of a visual stimulus: from left to right, the EEG reading of brain activity at rest, and at two points in time following the introduction of a picture. As an engineer, Campbell holds patents in image processing and high-definition television; as an artist, however, he deploys low-resolution pictures to explore perception, motion, and memory. Here, he translated a video of swimmers into graphic forms rendered across a three-panel grid of more than five thousand LED lights. At certain moments, the imagery resolves into figures who pass across the field; at other times, it dissolves into an animated abstraction. Interested in the balance among external stimuli, human anatomy, and individual experience in the process of sight, Campbell aims to distill essential elements of visual comprehension, describing the<br>experience of his work as “more like feeling an image than seeing it.”",
