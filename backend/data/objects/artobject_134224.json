            "textentryhtml":"<p>Undeterred by dangerous circumstances and motivated by commercial success, Thomas C. Roche was among the few battlefield photographers to remain near the Petersburg, Virginia, front during the last days of the Civil War, producing one of the most extensive series of battlefield views. Many of his photographs are stereographs, a format that places two images taken at slightly different angles side by side on a single card. When viewed through a binocular device called a stereoscope, the two images coalesce into one, producing an illusion of three-dimensionality. Widely distributed to convey narratives related to the recent war, these stereographs serve as examples of photography’s role as a tool of mass communication.</p><p>As part of Roche’s <em>War Views</em> series,<em> \"Fort Damnation\"</em> shows a dead Confederate soldier lying along the foot passage of the trenches, which diagonally cuts through the composition. While the body appears intact, the blood stain around his nose and mouth reminds the viewer of the cruel reality of the war. The soldier’s face is calm, and his arms are crossed over his stomach—a pose that he could not have assumed naturally upon his death. Thomas Roche, like many other Civil War photographers, did not simply photograph the scenes he found but rather manipulated bodies and objects for aesthetic effect. Like<em> “Fort Hell”</em> (2018-52), this image recalls the conventions of antebellum post-mortem photography, quite popular among those who could afford it. </p><p><br></p>",
