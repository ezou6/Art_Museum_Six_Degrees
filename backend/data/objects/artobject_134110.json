She began her career as a photojournalist but quickly was drawn to the graphic potential of dance, about which she wrote for <em>The Village Voice</em> from 1973 to the mid-1990s. While the focus of the photographs appears to be motion, the artist has noted that the subtext is time: “time is stopped, a split second becomes an eternity.” Greenfield’s work with dancers was typically improvisational rather than rehearsed, capturing moments that were often high risk and could not be repeated.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",
