Modeled after seventeenth-century European chairs, the portable “throne” became a symbol of Chokwe chiefly authority. By constructing this chair out of separate pieces of wood in the European fashion, its sculptor was able to depict figurative scenes characterizing daily and ritual life in the Chokwe kingdom. When ideas and techniques migrated to a new continent, they combined with local traditions to give rise to innovative aesthetic forms. </P>\r\n<P>Juliana Ochs Dweck, Andrew W.

Unlike the monoxylous stools typical of sub-Saharan design, this chair is constructed of separate pieces of wood joined together. Chokwe artists adapted its shape from European-style chairs introduced by Portuguese traders in the seventeenth century, and embellished the backrest and rungs with three-dimensional carvings of single figures and vignettes that catalogue the daily and ritual life of the court. In this example, a Chihongo masquerade figure wearing an oval hoop skirt and winged headdress artfully spans the top rail. The figure is echoed on the front stretcher by two masqueraders with skirts flared as if in motion. Depicted on the left rung is likely one of the chief’s sons or nephews, recognizable by his rounded top hat, while on the right rung a court musician plays a drum.</P></SPAN>",
