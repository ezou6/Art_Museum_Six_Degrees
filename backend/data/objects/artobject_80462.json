Weston was one of the founding members of a San Francisco–based collective of photographers known as Group f.64, named for the smallest aperture on a large-format camera, a setting that creates crisply focused images. His aesthetic shaped the vision for a new Modernist style of photography, foregrounding the camera’s ability to focus attention on the beauty of details and the play of light on the surface of natural materials.",
