His poor eyesight meant he did not receive his father’s instruction in painting but instead was groomed to manage \"Peale’s Museum,\" the public display of art and natural history Charles Willson began to develop during Rubens’s youth. It was not until the age of seventy-one that Peale was taught to paint — by his daughter, Mary. <I>Still Life with Watermelon</I>, completed during Rubens’s eighty-first year, offers eloquent testimony that he ended his brief career at the peak of his powers. A finely balanced, completely assured example of the artist’s numerically modest oeuvre, the painting partakes of the quiet simplicity of his brother Raphaelle’s frieze-like, Neoclassical compositions, executed decades earlier, and relates as well to his uncle James Peale’s horizontal tabletop arrangements of indirectly illuminated fruit, including the pictorial device of a piece of fruit shown overhanging the table’s edge, relieving its insistent planarity. </P></SPAN>",

A cluster of grapes hangs over the table’s edge, casting a subtle shadow and giving depth to the otherwise friezelike composition. One of many artistic children in the Peale family, Rubens Peale had poor eyesight and thus did not receive instruction in painting from his father, Charles Willson Peale. Instead, Rubens was tasked with managing Peale’s Museum, the public display of art and natural history specimens that the elder Peale founded in Philadelphia in 1784. Rubens was taught to paint only later, at the age of seventy-one, by his daughter, Mary. The still-life paintings that he produced in the final decade of his life hearken back to the clear, balanced, and understated Neoclassical paintings created earlier in the nineteenth century by his uncle,\n<br />\nJames Peale, and brother Raphaelle.\n",
