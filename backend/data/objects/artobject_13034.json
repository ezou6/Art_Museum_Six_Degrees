Quoted in an essay by Truman Capote that accompanied the artist’s first book of photographs, <I>Observations </I>(1959), Avedon highlighted the very features that would set him apart from his contemporaries and that made him a defining figure in postwar American photography. Fashion photography was the foundation of Avedon’s career, and his pictures of models conveying emotion and in motion were a revolutionary departure from the norm of neutral expressions and static poses. Avedon successfully bridged the worlds of commercial and artistic photography, garnering respect in both realms; he was a driving force behind photography’s emergence as a fine-art form in the 1960s and ’70s. </P></SPAN>",
