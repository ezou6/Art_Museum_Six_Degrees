Carved in high relief standing on a lotus base is a central buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas with halos around their heads. In between, in low relief, are two donor figures each turned to face the center. Each donor holds a closed lotus blossom. Behind the central buddha is a large leaf- or boat-shaped nimbus with nine small buddhas. At the apex is a descending dragon. Outside the nimbus are eleven flying apsaras with musical instruments. There are calligraphic cartouches above each donor figure, and the donors’ 525 inscription dedicated to their parents and ancestors is engraved on the base. This is a composite or collage rubbing (quanxing ta 全形拓) of a back-screen style (beiping shi 背屏式) stele with a triangular top. The stone was unearthed in 1918 at Yidu 益都 in Shandong province and entered the collection of the Shandong Provincial Museum in 1953. The back and sides (PUAM y1957-190 a-b) of the stele are carved with rows of small buddhas. ",
