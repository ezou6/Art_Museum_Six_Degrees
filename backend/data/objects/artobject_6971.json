This drawing is one of a series of sketches in which he depicted the allegorical origins of Shakespeare’s lyric genius. In 1792, the wealthy publisher John Boydell commissioned Romney to paint the subject on a grand scale for his newly established Shakespeare Gallery, London. Here, Romney copied the frontal pose for his infant Shakespeare from <I>The Infant Hercules Strangling Serpents</I>, created in 1786 by his friend Sir Joshua Reynolds for Catherine II of Russia, for which the oil sketch hanging below was a study.</P></SPAN>",
