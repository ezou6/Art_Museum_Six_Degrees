            "textentryhtml":"Entirely self-taught, Niki de Saint Phalle was a French painter and sculptor with an idiosyncratic personal style that has been characterized as “outsider art.” Naive, lighthearted, whimsical, or joyful, her works were often freely composed, as here, where the work seems to have been drawn spontaneously. Her graphic output was prodigious, but she was also one of few women artists of her generation to work on a monumental scale in sculpture. Saint Phalle frequently collaborated with artists such as Jasper Johns and the composer John Cage, as well as—over several decades—the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely, who became her second husband in 1971. The two regularly sent hand-drawn cards like this one to Duane Wilder, who was a close friend.",
