Engraved above the figure in running-script calligraphy is the “Lament of Liangfu,” an ancient folk ballad from the Spring and Autumn period (770-ca. 470 BC) about how two peaches were used to kill three warriors that Zhuge Liang was said to have liked. <br></p><p>Zhao Hong’en was a Chinese bannerman official. In 1719 when holding office in present-day Hubei province, he drove out to Longzhong 隆中 to search for traces of the Marquis of Wu (Wu Hou 武侯) Zhuge Liang. He found a broken stele in the river and had rebuilt a Wu Hou Shrine, which was finished in 1720. Inside the shrine he erected three stelae. The center stele was engraved a portrait of Zhuge Liang and the “Lament of Liangfu.” Flanking stelae were erected inscribed, respectively, with the “Former” and “Latter Chu Shi Biao,” two memorials written by Zhuge Liang.<br></p>",
