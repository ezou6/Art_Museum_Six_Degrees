The left section is nearly complete, lacking only bars on the window and decoration on a robe. To the right, the paint layers are peeled back progressively, so the underpainting is revealed in less and less finished layers. There have been attempts to attribute the replica to a David student and to explain why it is unfinished. </P>\r\nPerhaps the most convincing argument has been put forth by the scholar Thomas Crow, who has asserted that the finished parts are by Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson (1767–1824), and that the canvas was painted as a demonstration for students. Crow has even attributed the least finished portion to David himself, in a revolutionary reversal of normal workshop procedure, in which students prepare the underlayers and the master applies the final touches. The work is a perfect teaching tool (like an anatomical model that peels away layers of skin, fat, and muscle, finally to reveal bones), and the painting likely served that purpose in the studio of David, despite the lack of any mention of it in the texts of the time. </P>\r\nDavid’s celebrated composition depicts &shy;Socrates about to drink the poison that the Athenian state decreed as his punishment for subverting the youths of the city with his philo&shy;sophical interrogations. His disciples bid him adieu. In 1787, Socrates was a model to those who wished to reform France’s government along the lines suggested by the contemporary &shy;<I>philosophes</I>, who were themselves subject to censorship and persecution. </P></SPAN>",

            "textentryhtml":"<p>This painting depicts the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, who drinks poisonous hemlock rather than renounce his beliefs after he was convicted of corrupting Athenian youth with his teachings. Like the contemporary artist Yinka Shonibare, whose work is on view nearby, David turned to history to interpret present-day events. Painting on the eve of the French Revolution, the artist intended this scene to serve as an allegory for independent thought at a moment of political change. This rough canvas appears to be a lifetime copy of David’s signed version of <i>The Death of Socrates</i>, perhaps intentionally unfinished to instruct David’s students on the techniques of painting. The left section is nearly complete, the transition from greater to lesser degrees of finish demonstrating the stages of its construction. Scholars suggest that David painted the least-finished portions himself while his student Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson may have completed the more-finished areas, reversing typical studio procedure. Today, the work continues to serve as a teaching tool.\n</p><p>Comparative image: Jacques-Louis David, <i>The Death of Socrates</i>, 1787. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.
