The flattened forms, the prevalence of profiles and bold silhouettes, and the manner in which protagonists avoid the viewer’s gaze contribute to an aristocratic, artificial atmosphere. The jarring juxtapositions of&nbsp;colors build on Florentine painting traditions but&nbsp;without the softening shading and suave harmonies of a previous generation. These qualities are all hallmarks of the mid-sixteenth-&shy;century Florentine Mannerists. </P>\r\nThe imposing figure of the Virgin holds an overly large baby on her lap, the child Jesus, who appears about to slide forward. His posture prefigures the dead adult Christ cradled on his mother’s lap in the Pietà. Here, however, the interaction among the figures is more complex. Jesus turns backward toward his cousin, Saint John — also a miraculously born child — and grasps his staff. While Christ was born of a virgin, John was the child of the elderly Saint Elizabeth, who had long been infertile. Margaret, an early Christian saint from Antioch, is depicted with a dragon, from which she reportedly emerged unharmed after having been swallowed. Because of this apocryphal tale, women in labor invoked her. Mary looks toward this advocate for pregnant women, reminding the viewer of her own role as the Virgin of Childbirth. These references suggest that the painting may have been commissioned as an ex-voto celebrating the birth of an heir. </P></SPAN>",

Yerkes (1837-1905), and became an avid art collector herself with Yerkes’ support. In 1912 when her collection was sold at auction, she also sold her mansion at 660 Park Avenue that Yerkes had built for her and moved to London. See https://research.frick.org/directory/detail/4803. For Yerkes, see https://research.frick.org/directory/detail/1159.</p>\n<p>[3] The auction catalogue description of the painting states: \"Francesco dei Rossi (Called Salviati) 1510- 1563. 1174. Madonna and Child with St. John and an Angel. The fair-haired mother in a pink dress with her blue mantle across her knees is seated, the nude boy in her lap. Her head is seen in profile as she <font face=\"TimesNewRomanPSMT\">turns to an angel seen at her back. The Child turns away from her to take a reed cross from the young St. John at his side. Salviati who took his name from his patron Cardinal Salviati, was a friend of Vasari while both were pupils of Andrea del Sarto and later of Bandinelli. The frame is Italian carved wood of XVI Century. Bought from Prince Panciatici’s Palace in Florence where it was said to have hung for three hundred years. Canvas.
