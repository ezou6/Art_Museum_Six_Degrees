These photographs are from his final assignment, which became known as the Wheeler Survey for its leader Lieutenant George M. Wheeler. During the expedition, O’Sullivan broadened his subject matter to include human subjects, such as Native American villagers. This album, featuring photographs collected from the 1871, 1872, and 1873 Wheeler expeditions, documents the expansive western landscape and its inhabitants. Albums had become a popular way for individuals to collect the cartes-de-visite portraits of friends and family members as well as to distribute science and travel imagery. Photographs could also be removed from albums to stand on their own, such as the print in this case.</P></SPAN>",
