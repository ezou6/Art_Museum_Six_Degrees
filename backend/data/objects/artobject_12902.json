He went on to accept a position as painter to the King following the restoration of the monarchy under Louis XVIII in 1814. In addition to painting flattering Neoclassical portraits, Gérard specialized in mythological and antique subjects, as in his painting depicting the blind poet Homer being led by a youth, skillfully reproduced in this engraving by Massard. The romantic image of Homer as the Blind Bard-wandering penniless but revered by the common man-was a subject favored by David and his students, for whom it represented the triumphant survival of the Arts following tempestuous years of revolution and war.",
