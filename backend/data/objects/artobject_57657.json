            "textentryhtml":"An imaginary group portrait of men from the Han to Yuan dynasties (2nd-13th century) who were associated with the transmission of the Shuowen jiezi 說文解字 (literally: Explaining Graphs and Analyzing Characters) lexicon, which was compiled by Xu Shen 許愼 (ca. 58-ca. 148) and completed in 100 during the Eastern Han dynasty. According to a 1779 colophon by Zhang Xun 張塤 (1769 jinshi degree) that is omitted on this partial rubbing, Xu Shen is the tall elderly figure leading the group at left, supported on each side by Jiang Shi 江式 (d. 523) and Yan Zhitui 顏之推 (531-591). Behind them is Li Yangbing 李陽冰 (Tang dynasty) followed by the brothers Xu Xuan 徐鉉 (916-991) and Xu Kai 徐鍇 (920-974). In the rear is Zhang Youye 張有也 (?) and Wu Qiuyan 吾邱衍 (1272-1311), who walks with a stick because of his lame leg and carries books. The carved pictorial stone from which this rubbing was taken was based on a painting that the eccentric artist Luo Ping made in 1799 for the Shandong scholar and calligrapher Gui Fu 桂馥 (1736-1805), who had studied the Shuowen jiezi. After the painting was finished, Gui Fu asked many of his acquaintances, including the philosopher, calligrapher, and writer Weng Fanggang 翁方綱 (1733-1818) to inscribe it. Although more than one version of this painting that are attributed to Luo Ping survive, including one in the Shandong Museum, it is possible that the pictorial stone may no longer be extant. ",
