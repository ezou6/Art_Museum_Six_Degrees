Although he lived to the age of eighty, Munch’s fragile health and family history gave him cause for concern: his mother and one of his sisters succumbed to tuberculosis (called “consumption” at the time), another sister was institutionalized for mental illness, and his brother died of pneumonia at age thirty. In this haunting and funereal<br>self-portrait, Munch graphically fused his deepest personal anxieties with the bare essentials—name, date, disembodied head, and skeletal right arm—of his mental and physical identity.",

Here, the somber, deep-black ground is relieved only by the artist’s skeletal arm; his face, with a haunting, vacant expression; and the white rectangular form that illuminates the base of his neck. We are faced with a stark image of the thirty-two-year-old Munch contemplating his mortality during a wonderfully vibrant moment in his career, when he was embraced by avant-garde artistic circles that advocated explorations of psychological and physical unease.\n</p>\n<p>\n\t<br /><b>\n\tJanet Rauscher</b>, Editor, Princeton University Art Museum\n</p>",
