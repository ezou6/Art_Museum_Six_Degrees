Church produced a series of spectacular paintings of tropical scenes that combine panoramic scope with precise, accurate detail, proposing and offering revelation through scientific knowledge. <I>Passing Shower in the Tropics</I>, a modestly scaled iteration of these South American subjects, shares with other, later examples of the type a focus on atmospheric effects and the apparent representation of an amalgam of locations rather than a single particular site. </P></SPAN>",

For Church, the natural world was most truthfully represented as a series of adjacent environments shaped by changes in altitude and characterized by corresponding variations of ﬂora and fauna. His art articulated an early perception of earth’s fundamentally integrated character, anticipating the advent of ecology. These traits were an abiding concern for the artist following his exposure to the inﬂuential theories of the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859). Church visited South America twice during the 1850s, producing a series of grand tropical scenes that combine panoramic vistas with minute, accurate detail. This later, modestly scaled painting similarly focuses on precise atmospheric effects and the representation of nature according to discrete climatic zones.\n",
