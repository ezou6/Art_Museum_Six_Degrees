I was aware that it was illegal, but I didn’t really think much about that at the time. I was living in a bohemian world, where we just did what we pleased. I wasn’t speaking for anybody else. I was defending my way of living.” The prints should not be read as literal illustrations of the poems, but rather as nostalgia for fleeting but memorable encounters.<br></p><p><br></p>",
