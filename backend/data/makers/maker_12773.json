    "biography":"Born in 1943, Howardena Pindell is a distinguished African American artist, teacher, and curator whose work is associated with many of the defining movements of postwar art, including abstraction, conceptualism, minimalism, and process art. Through her art and her actions, Pindell has also spent much of her career addressing, deconstructing, and fighting sexism and racism in the art world and the world at large.\r\n\r\nIn her work from the 1970s, Pindell was influenced by an extended trip she took to Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal in 1973 with Lowry Stokes Sims and by a suite of exhibitions on African art that she saw in New York around the same time (especially an exhibition of African textiles and decorative arts organized by MoMA in 1972-3). As she has written, “African influences came by way of seeing loose hanging textiles, both here and in Africa. I saw nails in nkisi sculpture. I also was aware of a kind of stenciling and sewing together of loose fabrics as well as having a very dense and energetic surface tension in my paintings and works on paper.” The role of accumulation in African art, likewise the flexibility of the systems it so often employs, also informs her work.\r\n\r\nPindell received her MFA from Yale in 1967. She has worked as a professor in the art department at SUNY Stony Brook since 1979. Between 1967 and 1971, she was employed at MOMA, first as a curatorial assistant in the Department of Drawings and Prints, and then as an assistant curator in the Department of Prints and Illustrated Books. She was a founding member of the AIR Gallery, the first women’s cooperative in New York City, and an early member of the Committee against Racism in the Arts, formed in 1979. Pindell has received numerous grants and awards, including the Guggenheim Fellowship, two National Endowment for the Arts grants, and a Joan Mitchell Grant, a Studio Museum in Harlem Artist Award as well as an Anonymous Was a Woman Award and the Most Distinguished Body of Work or Performance Award from the College Art Association.",

            "body":"<p>This installation complements the Museum’s special exhibition <em>Helen Frankenthaler Prints: Seven Types of Ambiguity</em> (June 29–October 20). <em>Women Artists and Abstraction</em> features works on paper and photographs by women artists who contributed to the development of abstraction as a visual language from the postwar era to the present. Photographs by Lotte Jacobi, Barbara Morgan, and Naomi Savage exemplify the artists’ shared interest in process experimentation and image manipulation. Jacobi’s <em>Photogenics</em> were produced by moving lights and torches over light-sensitive paper. Fueled by her passion for modern dance, Morgan used a similar process to capture the essence of ephemeral movements. Experimentation with form and color is the driving force behind the tautly composed gouaches of Judith Rothschild, the rhythmic etching by Sonia Delaunay, and Alice Baber’s layered ink drawing, the latter made in response to the artist’s travel to Brazil. By contrast, monochromatic works by Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Agnes Martin, and Eve Aschheim focus on form using simple geometrical lines that draw attention to the picture plane. Howardena Pindell’s conceptual collage employs ordinary hole punches—normally associated with office work and schools—which she then inscribed with numbers, shapes, and arrows to create “very small points of color and light” without having to rely on paintbrushes. Conversely, the delicate lines of poured ink in Dorothea Tanning’s lithograph and the energetic strokes in Susan Rothenberg’s etchings communicate a strong gestural language. An equally complex exploration of gender identity informs Miriam Schapiro’s small watercolors as well as a more recent etching by Mona Hatoum. Schapiro used ovoid and anthropomorphic shapes—suggestive of fertility and creativity, as well as of growth and metamorphosis—to forge a female iconography. In her recent etching, Hatoum instead drew on a minimalist aesthetic to depict coiling tendrils of human hair, a specifically feminine material prominently featured in her work.&nbsp;</p><p>--Annabelle Priestley, Curatorial Assistant</p>",
