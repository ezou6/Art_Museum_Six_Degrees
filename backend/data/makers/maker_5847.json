            "body":"[This] Henry Farrer is the first work to enter the collection by this artist known for his delicate drawings, watercolors, and etchings. Henry Farrer was largely a self-taught artist. He was a founding member of the American Society of Painters in Water Color, but he was perhaps best known by his contemporaries as an etcher. He was closely associated with the American Pre-Raphaelite movement, and his earlier work reflects the Pre-Raphaelite aesthetic. However, in his works of the 1880s, the strict Ruskinian approach to nature of Farrer's earlier works gives way to a greater atmospheric and lyrical quality. Henry Farrer's close attention to detail, his restrained tonal range, and his meticulously refined brushwork are all demon­strated in Sunset Landscape with Pond.",
