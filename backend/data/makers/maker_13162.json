    "biography":"Henry Gurdon Marquand (1819-1902), American philanthropist and collector, was born in New York City on 11 April 1819. In 1839, upon the retirement from the jewelry business of his brother, Frederick (1799-1882), who was a liberal benefactor of Yale College and of the Union Theological Seminary, he became his brother's agent.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the purchasers in 1868 of the Iron Mountain railroad, afterwards its president, and a director of the Missouri-Pacific system. He was the first honorary member of the American Institute of Architects, and president (1889-1902) of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to which he made valuable presents and loans from his collection of paintings.\r\n\r\nHe died in New York City, on 26 February 1902, aged 82. His varied, and valuable art collection and rare books were sold in 1903. He was a benefactor of Princeton University and other institutions. His son, Allan Marquand (b. 1853), graduated from Princeton University in 1874, and in 1883 became professor of archaeology and art.\r\n\r\n",
