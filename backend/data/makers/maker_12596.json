    "biography":"AAT Note: Refers to the period and culture associated with the second age in the Three Age system developed by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen in 1836. It is characterized by the widespread use of bronze, which is an alloy of copper and tin, lead, antimony, or arsenic, in the manufacture of tools and weapons. It developed at different times in different parts of the world, from around 3,500 BCE in Greece and China to around 1,400 BCE in several areas of Europe. There was not a Bronze Age in the Americas, since the local Stone Age cultures were introduced directly to Iron Age technologies by European explorers.",
