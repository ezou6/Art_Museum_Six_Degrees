    "biography":"George Sheridan Knowles was born in Manchester in 1863. He painted portraits and genre subjects in both oils and watercolours. The artist was a member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours and an associate of the Royal Cambiran Academy in Manchester. Between 1885 and 1893 he exhibited a the Royal Academy, the Suffolk Street Gallery and the Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours and was awarded a jury commendation at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that people in the late 19th century looked back at the previous century with great interest and artists such as Knowles catered for this fascination. He captured well some of the aspects of the bygone era with sensitivity and skill. He depicted charming scenes of 'old' England which were a century away from the industrialization of the day. George Sheridan Knowles died in 1931.\r\n\r\nArtnet\r\n",
