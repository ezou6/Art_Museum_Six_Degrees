    "biography":"In 1873 Thomas Annan's brother Richard joined him in partnership forming T. & R. Annan & Sons Ltd., in Glasgow, Scotland. Thomas Annan had, since 1855, run a photography business entitled Thomas Annan, calotype printers. In the new business Thomas ran the photographic side of the company and Richard took care of administration. In 1883 Thomas Annan's son James Craig joined the firm. He accompanied his father to Vienna, Austria, to learn the photogravure technique from its inventor Karl Klic. The Annans bought the patent for the United Kingdom and brought the photogravure process to Britain. In 1888 after the death of Thomas Annan, James Craig Annan took over the portrait and photogravure side of the business and his brother John oversaw the administrative details. GEH states that the firm started by Thomas and Robert Annan in 1873 was suceeded by the firm \"Annan & Sons\" in 1888 when Robert Annan was joined by his nephews, John and James Craig Annan, after the death of their father Thomas, but based on AUER the firm retained the name T. & R. Annan & Sons, Ltd., which is still in use today. In 1889 T. & R. Annan & Sons Ltd. became the photographers and photoengravers to the Queen. James Craig Annan left the firm ca. 1939. Today T. & R. Annan & Sons Ltd. work in collaboration with the publisher Maclehose in book publishing; they also produce paper for charcoal process as well as plates and chemical processes (ULAN).",
