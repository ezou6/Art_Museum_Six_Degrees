Born in Portland Oregon on October 25, 1870, Morris was the son of the Anglican Bishop of Portland.  He studied at the School of Architecture at Columbia University in New York City and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.    Morris was one of the major establishment architects of his day.  Projects included participating in the design for the Public Library of New York City while at Carrere and Hastings, and as an independent practitioner the ’79 dormitory and Patton Hall at Princeton University, the Connecticut State Armory, various major buildings in Hartford Connecticut, the first skyscraper in Portland Oregon in 1907, and three skyscrapers in New York City.
