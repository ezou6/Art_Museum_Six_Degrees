    "biography":"Baik Yoon Moon was one of the pioneers of modern Korean art in the early to middle 20th century. He was the disciple of the artist Kim Eun Ho (an important early 20th century artist) and was well-known for his landscape paintings and portraits. He was active in the 1920s and 1930s and participated eight times in the invitation-only National Art Exhibition of Korea. In 1935 he was accused by the Japanese of painting a seditious image and was taken to Japan. There he was imprisoned and tortured. It was only in 1978, one year before his death, that he started painting and exhibiting again.",
