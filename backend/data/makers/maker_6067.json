    "biography":"American aerial photographer elevated a practical procedure to the level of fine art. Two collections of his work have been published, \"The Extraordinary Landscape,\" (1982) and \"William Garnett Aerial Photographs,\" (1984). An ardent conservationist, Garnett became concerned about land use and air pollution in the early 1940s. He made this photograph in an attempt to raise public awareness. Over the years Garnett came to believe that he was more likely to inspire positive change by pointing out nature's enduring beauty than by showing the ugliness caused by poor choices. ULAN",
