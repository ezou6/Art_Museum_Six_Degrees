    "biography":"Born 6 August 1839; died 12 August 1911. In 1871, Stillfried moved to Yokohama, Japan and opened a photographic studio called \"Stillfried & Co.\" which operated until 1875. In 1875 Stillfried associated with another photographer named Andersen, of whom little is known. The studio became \"Stillfried & Andersen\" also known as the \"Japan Photographic Association\", which operated until 1885. In 1877 the firm of Stillfried & Andersen bought the stock of Felice Beato and moved into his studio. In the late 1870s Stillfried visited and photographed in Dalmatia, Bosnia, and Greece. Stillfried also trained many Japanese in photography. In 1886 upon his departure from Japan, Stillfried sold the majority of his stock to his protégé, the Japanese photographer Kusakabe Kimbei (ULAN).",
