The company was one of the pioneers of the new electroplating process (silver-plating on base metal) and was an important manufacturer of Britannia metal (see under PEWTER). Its designers included CHRISTOPHER DRESSER, who between 1879 and 1882 sold some 37 designs to Dixon’s, many of which (notably his Japanese-inspired teapots) were put into production.",
