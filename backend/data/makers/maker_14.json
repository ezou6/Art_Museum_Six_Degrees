    "biography":"Acier was brought to the Meissen Porcelain factory from France in an effort to revive the factory's export trade after the Seven Years War by introducing current French designs to their porcelain. Acier became joint Modellmeister at Meissen with Johann Joachim Kändler after 1764. Acier's work, very different from Kändler's, is sentimental and occasionally moralizing. He is noted for having introduced lacework to porcelain (ULAN).",
