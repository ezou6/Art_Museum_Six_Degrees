    "biography":"Austrian painter. He was apprenticed briefly to Johann Gottlieb Starmayr ( fl  1720–40), and from 1741 he worked independently. His oeuvre is informed by thorough study of examples of early Baroque painting in Austria and also of the rich collections of prints and drawings in the monasteries of Göttweig and Dürnstein. Through these works Schmidt familiarized himself with the Venetian repertory of form (which he may also have studied while travelling in northern Italy). Schmidt paid particular attention to the prints of Jacques Callot and the prints and drawings of Rembrandt; the latter encouraged Schmidt to practise drawing in ink. Figures derived from Rembrandt’s types recur in a number of variations in the staffage of Schmidt’s altarpieces. While his drawings are retardataire in character, his manner of incorporating the types he adopted into his paintings is quite inventive (GDA).",
