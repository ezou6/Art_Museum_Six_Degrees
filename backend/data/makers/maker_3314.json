    "biography":"Giulio Romano was probably apprenticed to Raphael when quite young, and by 1514 he is recorded as Raphael's assistant in the Vatican. His greatest achievements were monumental fresco cycles and architectural projects, which he conceived and oversaw. Giulio's contemporaries particularly praised the facility and inventiveness of his drawing. Most of his career was spent in Mantua, as court artist for Federico II Gonzaga.",
