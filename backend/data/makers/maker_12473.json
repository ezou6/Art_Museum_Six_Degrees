    "biography":"In 1850, Henry Negretti and Joseph Zambra established a partnership in London, England, as optical and scientific instrument makers and photographers. They were appointed optical instrument makers to Prince Albert, to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, London, and to the British Admiralty. In 1853, when the Crystal Palace was re-erected in Sydenham, England, Negretti and Zambra became the official photographers of the Crystal Palace Company, receiving the right to photograph and produce stereoviews of the interior and grounds of the new building. In 1856, Negretti and Zambra financed Francis Frith's photographic trip to Egypt, Nubia and Ethiopia, and from 1857 to 1860, the company produced over 500 stereoviews of Frith's voyage. In 1863, Henry Negretti was the first photographer to take aerial photographs of London from a balloon (ULAN).",
