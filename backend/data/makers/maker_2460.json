    "biography":"Franz Snyders studied with Pieter Breughel the Younger in 1593 and perhaps with Hinrock van Balen. He was made a master of the Antwerp guild in 1602, and went to Italy in 1608, returning to Antwerp from Milan the following year. He married Margaretha de Vos, the sister of Cornelis and Pieter de Vos, and soon acquired a reputation. Van Dyck considered him the best of the collaborators of Rubens.",
