    "biography":"Rudulph Evans (February 1, 1878-January 16, 1960), sculptor, was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Virginia. He studied in France at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and with Auguste Rodin and Augustus Saint-Gaudens. After returning to the United States in 1900, he maintained a studio in New York City. He moved back to Washington, D.C., in 1949. Evans designed the statue of Thomas Jefferson inside the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., in cooperation with the Japanese engineer Wado Zato. His other noted works include the statues of Julius Sterling Morton (1937) and of William Jennings Bryan (1937), both in the National Statuary Hall Collection of the United States Capitol. Evans also sculpted the statue of Robert E. Lee (1932) in the Virginia State Capitol.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nYonkers, Tescia Ann. \"Behold His Bronze Likeness: Rudulph Evans's Statue of Robert E.
