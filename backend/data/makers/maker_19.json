    "biography":"The Adams family had potteries in Staffordshire as early as 1650. At that date two brothers, William and Thomas had separate ventures in Burslem. Such family activity has continued to the present. William Adams and Company, with large potteries in Tunstall is managed by members who are the 11th and 12th generations in direct descent from the original 17th century Adams of Burslem. \r\nAttributing examples of china marked Adams to a particular man can be complicated and confusing because so many of them bore the same given name, William. This is particularly true with collectible Adams china. In the latter part of the 18th-century and continuing into the 19th, there were three William Adams. All were cousins and operated their own large potteries independent of the others. Further, with one exception, they were succeeded by sons of the same given name who, in the main, continued making the same kinds of wares. They were: \r\nWilliam Adams (I) 1745-1805, of Greengate, Tunstall\r\nWilliam Adams (II) 1748-1831, of Brickhouse, Burslem and later Cobridge Hall, Cobridge\r\nWilliam Adams (III) 1772-1829, of Stoke-on-Trent \r\nImportant also was: \r\nWilliam Adams (IV) 1798-1865, of Greenfield, Tunstall, son and successor to William Adams III\r\n\r\nTaken from http://www.thepotteries.org/mark/a/adams.html\r\n\r\nSee also http://www.thepotteries.org/potters/adams.htm",
