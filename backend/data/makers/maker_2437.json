As with all of Smith’s works, this piece was conceived as an abstract geometric sculpture and was given its title, Moses, only after the artist had fabricated a mock-up. Here, the parallel upright forms suggested to Smith the horns in Michelangelo’s Moses. As the artist explained: “Mistranslation resulted in Michelangelo’s peculiar presentation of a horned Moses. My sculpture, without previous intent, perpetuates this curiosity.” In contrast to the Cor-Ten steel often seen in Princeton’s sculpture, Smith preferred “mild” steel, which is lighter and more easily manipulated and joined. \n\n",
