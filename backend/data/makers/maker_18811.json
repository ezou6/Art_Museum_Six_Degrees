    "biography":"William Herman Rau was one of the preeminent commercial photographers in the United States in the late 19th century. Rau reached greatest fame picturing the developed landscapes of the American East, spurred by his commissions from the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Lehigh Valley Railroad to document their vast miles of track. Rau began his career as a successful expeditionary photographer in the American West and abroad, popularizing his journeys in the form of stereo cards and lantern slides. Rau’s first photographs related to industrialization documented the displays at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. After opening his own studio in 1886 in the same city, Rau not only achieved fame through his railroad commissions, but as the official photographer of the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904. Falling into obscurity after the rise of the Photo-Secession and artistic photography, Rau has received renewed attention in recent years as an exemplar of the mutually beneficial relationship between photographers and the railroad industry in the Gilded Age.",
