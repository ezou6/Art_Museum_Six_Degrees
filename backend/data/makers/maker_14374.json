    "biography":"Irish-born American Presbyterian clergyman, Gilbert Tennent, was the son of William Tennent, the founder of Log College, a theological school in Pennsylvania, regarded as the precursor to Princeton University. Gilbert was a leading preacher of the Great Awakening of religious feeling in Colonial America. A stirring, enthusiastic preacher, he gave sermons throughout the colonies that led many to experience conversion. However, his religious zeal and often incendiary sermons were controversial amongst other Presbyterians. In 1743,Tennent became the pastor of a church in Philadelphia, where he remained for the rest of his ministry. He became sponsor for College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and in 1753 he went to Great Britain with Samuel Davies to secure funds for the college. He died in 1762 in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
