    "biography":"Carr studied at the California School of Design in San Francisco from 1891-1894. After studying abroad in London, she settled in Vancouver and produced work influenced by the art and artefacts of Northwest Coast Indians. She moved to Victoria after an unsuccessful exhibit, and ceased to paint for the next 15 years. In Ottawa in 1927, after meeting Lawren Harris and members of the Group of Seven, she returned to Victoria and began to paint once again, her work still greatly influenced by Indian culture. As a writer, she published seven books, winning the Governor-General's Award for Literature in 1942 (ULAN).",
