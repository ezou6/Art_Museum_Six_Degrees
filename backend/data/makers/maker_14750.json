    "biography":"John Macpherson, Class of 1766, met a hero's death in the attack on Quebec in 1775. As an undergraduate, MacPherson had been one of the founders of the Plain Dealing Club, predecessor of the American Whig Society. He had also become a great friend of William Patterson-later to be a framer of the Constitution, and associate justice of the Supreme Court--and the two corresponded frequently for several years after MacPherson graduated. In July 1775, shortly after the outbreak of the Revolution, Macpherson became aide-de-camp to Genral Richard Montgomery with the rank of Captain, and soon was promoted to major. He accompanied Montgomery in the march to Canada and was at his side in the desperate assault on Quebec, December 31, 1775, in which both were killed.\r\n\r\nPrinceton Portraits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
