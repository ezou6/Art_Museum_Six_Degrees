    "biography":"Aaron Burr, Sr. was the College of New Jersey's (now Princeton) second president. His predecessor, Jonathan Dickinson, died the year he took office, and for this reason, it was Burr who did most of the work of organizing the College and making it a reality. During his tenure as president, the curriculum of the College was established, the student body was enlarged tenfold, and a permanent home was found in Princeton. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
