    "biography":"Benjamin Rush (December 24, 1745 – April 19, 1813) was a Founding Father of the United States. Rush lived in the state of Pennsylvania and was a devout Christian, physician, writer, educator, and humanitarian, as well as the founder of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nRush was also a signatory of the Declaration of Independence and attended the Continental Congress. Later in life, he became a professor of medical theory and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania. Despite having a wide influence on the development of American government, he is not as widely known as many of his American contemporaries. Rush was also an early opponent of slavery and capital punishment.\r\n\r\nDespite his great contributions to early American society, Rush is today most famous as the man who, in 1812, helped reconcile the friendship of two of the largest minds of the early Republic: Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.[1][clarify] (Wikipedia)\r\n\r\n",
