            "description":"his fourteen minute documentary follows the remarkable and labor-intensive creation of Ursula von Rydingsvard \"URODA,\" a site specific sculpture commissioned to highlight the entrance to the new Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University.\n\nThe nineteen-foot-tall work is von Rydingsvard’s first sculpture made primarily of copper. Her full-sized maquette, created using stacked, texturized cedar beams shaped with a circular saw, took six months to build. The finished piece—made of more than 3,000 hand-pounded copper pieces—was fabricated by the metal artist Richard Webber and a team of skilled craftspeople.\n\nPrinceton University is home to one of the most significant public art collections in the United States. This most recent addition to Princeton’s outdoor sculpture collection was installed in Fall 2015 and dedicated in spring 2016 with the new building, designed by architects Tod Williams, Princeton class of 1965, and Billie Tsien.",
