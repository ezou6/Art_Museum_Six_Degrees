    "biography":"Dublin-born, Matthew Carey, was an editor, publisher and writer who lived in Philadelphia.  After moving to Paris from Dublin in 1779, Carey met Benjamin Franklin, who hired him to work in his print office. He worked for Franklin for one year before returning to Ireland to edit two Irish nationalist newspapers. To avoid British prosecution, in 1784 Carey immigrated to the United States and established a book shop and a publication business in Philadelphia with funds lent to him by the Marquis de Lafayette. Carey created the Pennsylvania Herald, Columbian Magazine, and American Museum. He also printed the first American version of the Douay Bible, in addition to the King James Version. Carey wrote extensively on social and political topics and took a special interest in the development of American naval strength.\r\n\r\n",
