    "biography":"Benjamin Falk was a theatrical photographer and a maker of theatrical portraits, whose first studio opened on Union Square in 1877. Though forgotten (in the tradition of celebrity photographers) by later generations, Falk played a central role in the nascent publicity machines of Gilded-Age and ragtime New York. Besides being the first photographer to depict a theatrical performance in process (in 1883, using electric lighting at Madison Square Theater), he was a canny competitor and successor to Napoleon Sarony (whom he outdid in portraying strongman Eugene Sandow as Hercules), an elder rival to Edward Steichen and Adolph De Meyer, and a stylistic progenitor of Fabian Bachrach-who, as an apprentice in Falk's studio, learned to deploy electric lighting to sculptural effect.",
