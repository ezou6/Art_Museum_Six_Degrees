    "biography":"Born in Shanghai, Jiawei Shen was recognized by the Chinese government for his paintings depicting 'revolutionary' images of workers and soldiers. His best known work from that period, \"Standing Guard for Our Great Motherland\" (1974) was subsequently shown in the Guggenheim Museum, both in New York and Bilbao, in the China: 5000 Years exhibition, in 1998.\r\n\r\nShen's large-scale historical paintings from this period are represented in major public collections; including the National Art Gallery of China and the Museum of the Chinese Revolution in Beijing. \r\n\r\nIn 1989, Shen moved to Australia where he became one of Australia's leading portrait painters.\r\n\r\nAmong his  best known portraits are Melbourne's Lord Mayor; John So in a possum skin cloak (2003), the Hon. Tom Hughes AO QC and the portrait of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark (2005) which hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, Canberra.\r\n",
