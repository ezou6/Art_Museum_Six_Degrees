    "biography":"Harry Hammond Hess (May 24, 1906 – August 25, 1969) was a geologist and United States Navy officer in World War II.\r\n\r\nConsidered one of the \"founding fathers\" of the unifying theory of plate tectonics, Rear Admiral Dr. Harry Hammond Hess was born on May 24, 1906 in New York City. He is best known for his theories on sea floor spreading, specifically work on relationships between island arcs, seafloor gravity anomalies, and serpentinized peridotite, suggesting that the convection of the Earth's mantle was the driving force behind this process. This work provided a conceptual base for the development of the theory of plate tectonics.\r\n",
