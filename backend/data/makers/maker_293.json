    "biography":"The Beardsley Limner was an itinerant artist who worked along the old Boston Post Road, in Connecticut and Massachusetts, from about 1785 to 1805. He or she executed some of the most striking naive portraits in New England, and was given the name The Beardsley Limner based on portraits of Elizabeth and Hezekiah Beardsley (painted ca. 1785-1790). Recently it has been argued that the Beardsley Limner and a Connecticut pastelist, Sarah Perkins, were one and the same. While some stylistic similarities exist between the two, there are sufficient differences to raise questions about this identification. To date no documentation of the Beardsley Limner's identity has been found in any of the sitters' records (ULAN).",
