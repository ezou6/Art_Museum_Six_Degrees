    "biography":"Robert Francis Goheen (1919 - March 31, 2008) was an American academic, educated at The Lawrenceville School and graduating from Princeton University in 1940. Born in Vengurla, India, he was an intelligence officer in the United States Army during World War II, reaching the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He returned to graduate school at Princeton after the war, earning an M.A. (1947) and Ph.D. (1948) in classics.\r\nGoheen taught classics at Princeton until 1957, when he was appointed the university's 16th president -- the youngest man to assume that position since the 18th century. After his retirement from Princeton in 1972, he was named president of the Council on Foundations and then of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation. From 1977-80, he was United States Ambassador to India. He died in Princeton, New Jersey. (Wikipedia)\r\n",
