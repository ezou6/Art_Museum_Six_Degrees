    "biography":"The Achilles Painter was a prominent painter of red-figure as well as a great master of painting white funerary lekythoi during the high Classical period. He was a student of the Berlin Painter toward the end of the older artist's career. He is known for his fine draftsmanship and his graceful linear style inherited from the Berlin Painter. His name comes from the hero of the Trojan War, whom he depicted on a famous red-figured amphora now in the collection of the Vatican Museums (ULAN).",
