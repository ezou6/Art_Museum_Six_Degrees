            "body":"During the Russian civil war, Repin lived in isolation, in declining health and financial straits. He turned to religious themes for inspiration during this trying period. ln a letter of 1921 to his friend A. F. Koni, whom he had feared was killed in the war, Repin wrote, \"How I rejoiced [at the news that you are alive]' And that joy gave me the idea for a painting. I have been thinking how glad Christ must have been when he felt that he was alive ....\" Repin went on to describe the painting, including the frightened guard, crosses, and dogs, concluding,\"[t]he joy of the Resurrected is what I wanted to portray.\" The artist expressed his spiritual renewal in this image of Easter morning shown from Christ's point of view-a perspective that the viewer is also forced to adopt.\n",
