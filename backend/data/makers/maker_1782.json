Werner studied at the Vienna Imperial Academy, the National Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1932, he came to Los Angeles after working for several years in Argentina. Later, he later maintained studios in Woodstock, New York and Chandler, Arizona, and settled finally in La Jolla, California.
