    "biography":"Hawes worked as a miniature painter in Boston until 1841 when he abandoned painting for the daguerreotype process. In 1843 Hawes joined with Albert Sands Southworth and opened a daguerreotype studio in Boston. The two also began to produce daguerreotype equipment for other photographers. By 1851 the firm was producing portraits of celebrities and views of Boston. Southworth & Hawes continued to operate until 1861 when Southworth left the partnership. In 1860 Hawes abandoned the daguerreotype for paper prints. In 1862 Hawes created his own studio in Boston called \"J.J. Hawes, Photographer\" (ULAN).",
