    "biography":"Born 15 april 1824. Salzmann travelled to Palestine in 1850 to 1851 as a draughtsman for a French expedition to the East. Salzmann returned to Paris, France in 1851 and learned photography which he used as an aid to his archaeological research. In 1853 Salzmann was commissioned by the Ministry of Public Instruction to visit Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and the islands of the Archipelago to photograph locations visited by the Crusades. Salzmann returned to Paris in 1854 with calotypes of architectural fragments from the Romanesque, Byzantine, Latin, Arab, and Turkish periods of Jerusalem's history. He gave his plates to Blanquart-Evrard who published a book entitled \"Jerusalem, époques judaïque, romaine, chrétienne, arabe, explorations photographiques\". From 1858 to 1867 Salzmann worked in Rhodes, Greece documenting his discovery of the Camiros necropolis. In 1863 Salzmann returned to Jerusalem (ULAN).",
