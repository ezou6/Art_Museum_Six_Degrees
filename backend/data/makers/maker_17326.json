    "biography":"Jean-Auguste Barre was the son of the specialist in medals, Jean-Jacques Barre, who worked at the Paris Mint. Trained at the École des Beaux-Arts, Jean-Auguste was one of the Romantic masters who created small bronze sculptures for the expanding bourgeois market for historical and contemporary subjects during the July Monarchy (1830-1848), in addition to his high official activities. He was a prolific portraitist in the Third Empire (1852-1870), creating busts of Napoleon III and his family, and throughout his career produced historical works for the Salon, such as Ulyssees Recognized by his Dog (Salon of 1835) or François de Lorraine, duc de Guise (Salon of 1840), being rewarded for these works with the Legion of Honor in 1852. The small bronze works, on the other hand, were destined for tabletop display in homes rather than museums: the Louvre purchased a typical one only several years ago (Mary of Burgundy leaving for the Hunt, ca. 1840).
