    "biography":"Samuel Blair was elected President of Princeton College in 1767, but stepped aside in favor of John Witherspoon who reconsidered the position after first declining.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1741 to a Presbyterian minister, Blair graduated from the College of New Jersey in 1760 and served as tutor at the College from 1761 to 1764.  He then preached at the Presbytery of New Castle. In 1766, Blair became pastor of the old South Church in Boston, as a colleague of the Rev. Dr. Sewall.  In 1770, he received his Doctor of Divinity from the University of Pennsylvania and took up his residence in Germantown, now a part of Philadelphia. He stayed in Germantown for the remainder of his life except for two years when he served as chaplain in Congress.\r\n\r\n",
