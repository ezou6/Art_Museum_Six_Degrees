            "body":"Rohlfs was born in Holstein, the youngest son of a peasant. He fell from a tree at the age of fifteen, and later had his leg amputated. After studying at the Grossherzogliche Kunstakademie in Weimar, he explored a variety of subject matter. Before 1900 he primarily painted figurative compositions and monumental landscapes. His Expressionist works from the first decade of the twentieth century were influenced by the work of the Brucke, and his interest in Neo­Impressionism, Pointillism, and the work of Van Gogh encouraged him to use color more spontaneously. In 1910 he moved to Munich for two years, which coincided with his decision to pursue print-making. At this time, he abandoned landscapes and returned to figurative composition. He did not attain national success until the age of seventy, after which his inventive use of color flourished. In 1937 his art was declared \"degenerate\" and was removed from German museums.",
