    "biography":"Beaten moved to New York in 1929, and signed a contract for \"Vogue\" magazine. Many of his images from this period have a fantastic or Surrealistic look. He did not place the emphasis on the person or the clothing, creating instead fanciful backgrounds using materials such as cellophane or mirrors to create an atmospheric effect. During the 1930s he photographed well-known cultural and society figures, such as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Queen Elizabeth II. Beaton was commissioned by the Ministry of Information to take photographs of London and British RAF bases during World War II. He produced images of war torn cities, his most famous image of this period being a picture of wounded child clutching a toy, which was chosen for the cover of \"Life\" magazine in 1941. During the 1950s and 1960s, his work concentrated on mostly the theater and cinema, creating costume and sets for the stage productions of \"Gigi\" (1958) and \"My Fair Lady\" (1964). He was knighted in 1971. ULAN",
