    "biography":"Adlai Stevenson fell just short of the American presidency. He was the governor of Illinois from 1949 to 1953, and won the Democratic nomination for the Presidency in 1952 and 1956, but lost both elections to war hero Dwight Eisenhower. \r\n\r\nAt Princeton, he was a member of the board of the Daily Princetonian during his second and third years, and its managing editor during his fourth. He was also a member of the Senior Council, the Class Movie Committee, the Class Day Committee, Whig Hall, and Quadrangle Club, whose Board of Trustees he joined in his senior year. He was at Princeton during the first world war, an apprentice seaman at the Naval Training Unit here. \r\n\r\nAfter graduating, he attended law school at Harvard for two years. Then he returned home to work as assistant editor of his family newspaper while the courts probated his grandfather's will. He finished his education at Northwestern University in 1926. \r\n\r\nThe Princton Spectator, March 99, Volume 4\r\nWikipedia\r\n",
