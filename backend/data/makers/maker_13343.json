    "biography":"From around 1839, Henneman acted as assistant and fellow photographer to William Henry Fox Talbot, traveling and taking photographs in Britain and France. In 1843, he left Talbot's employ to become supervisor of a photographic printing and publishing establishment at Reading, Berkshire, England. Talbot continued to provide advice and financial support. Henneman moved his establishment to London in late 1846. Thomas Malone (born ca. 1823) acted briefly as his partner from 1848. In 1851 Henneman was appointed Photographer to the Queen. Henneman operated \"Nich. Henneman & Co.,\" London, from 1852 to 1854, and again from 1855 to 1858. From 1863 to 1868, Henneman worked for Napoleon Sarony and R.W. Thrupp in Birmingham, West Midlands. From 1868 to 1871, Henneman was working in London.",
