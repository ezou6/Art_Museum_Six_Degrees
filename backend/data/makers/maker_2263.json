    "biography":"Stilthda Simeon was a Haida artist from the village of Yan, across the water from Masset, who worked throughout the nineteenth century sculpting crest poles, masks, and other ceremonial objects for his own community, along with figures and masks made to appeal to settlers. His carvings were collected by ethnographers James Swan and Charles Newcombe, and missionaries Sheldon Jackson and William Duncan, and circulated to ethnographic collections throughout the world. His sculptures are particularly remarkable for their departures from canonical Northwest Coast subjects into new forms, such as the example of a reclining shaman figure in Princeton University Art Museum's collection. These works are noted for their realism, even among Haida sculpture of the era.\r\n\r\nAs per India Young, Research Specialist, Native American Art, 2018\r\n",
