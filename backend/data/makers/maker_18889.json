    "biography":"Anatsui was born in Ghana and currently lives and works between Ghana and Nigeria. He received a BA in 1969 from the College of Art at the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana. He is currently Professor of Sculpture, Fine and Applied Arts at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\r\n\r\nSince 1976, Antasui has been the subject of dozens of solo exhibition at galleries and museums the world over, including Old and New: An Exhibition of Sculpture in Assorted Wood by El Anatsui, The National Museum, Lagos, Nigeria (1991); Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui, which toured the Brooklyn Museum and three additional venues; El Anatsui: When I Last Wrote to You about Africa, organized by the Museum for African Art in New York (2010); El Anatsui: Gawu, which traveled to ten venues in the United Kingdom and the United States; and A Fateful Journey: Africa in the Works of El Anatsui, which appeared at three museums in Japan. Anatsui has been featured in many prestigious international exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale in both (1990) and (2007), the Paris Triennial in (2012), and Africa Remix (2004), then the largest survey of contemporary African art in Europe. Anatsui’s list of group exhibitions number in the dozens, and they date back to 1974, when his work was first showcased in Accra, Ghana. In the last five years, Anatsui has also created large scale public installations, including Broken Bridge II, commissioned by the Friends of the High Line (2012-2013) (for more information on this work, please see http://www.jackshainman.com/artists/el-anatsui/#exhibitions) and Tsiatsia – Searching for Connection, installed on the façade of the Royal Academy of Arts in London (2013). \r\n\r\nForty-six books and catalogues have been devoted to the work of Anatsui, some entirely, others partially, including the monographs El Anatsui: Art and Life (2012); El Anatsui at the Clark (2011), with a contribution from Okeke-Agulu; and El Anatsui: When I Last Wrote to You about Africa, with contributions from Okeke-Agulu and Kwame Anthony Appiah, Emeritus Professor at Princeton, as well as the important surveys Contemporary African Art since 1980 (2009), by Okeke-Agulu and Okwui Enwezor and Defining Contemporary Art: 25 Years in 200 Pivotal Artworks, co-authored by Enwezor. Close to a hundred authors have addressed Anatsui’s work in prominent journals, such as Art in America, New York Times, Artforum, Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art, and Parkett.\r\n\r\nAnatsui’s work is included in numerous private and public collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Centre Pompidou, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the St. Louis Art Museum, Missouri, the Museum Kunstpalast, Dusseldorf, the Setagaya Museum, Tokyo, the British Museum, and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi.",

            "title":"On View: Migration and Material Alchemy",
            "body":"<p><strong>On View&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Migration and Material Alchemy</strong><br>January 27–July 29, 2018</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Allegory, poetry, and processes of material and cultural translation are foregrounded in a selection of works by contemporary artists from around the globe. These artists present subjects and materials in states of indeterminacy &nbsp;to contend with issues of urgent social concern, including political upheaval, environmental degradation, displaced populations, and oppressive censorship. Working from positions of personal or political vulnerability, they provide a human context for matters of immense scope and imbue humble materials with spiritual or metaphorical resonance.</p><p>In transforming the detritus of a global economy into dazzling tapestries of color and pattern, the Ghanaian artist El Anatsui draws attention to the violent legacy of a trade network that sold humans into slavery in exchange for alcohol. His sculptures are made of hundreds of metal liquor bottle tops, stitched together with thin copper wire and then hung like undulating drapery so as to catch the light and resurrect the rich cultural heritage of Kente cloth once worn exclusively by the Asante and Ewe royalty of Ghana. Anatsui enacts a reversal, turning the conflicted history of his materials into works with multiple artistic associations.</p><p>A similar reversal is undertaken by the Brazilian American artist Vik Muniz, who created out of garbage a portrait of a mother and her two children, residents of a favela nestled between one of the world’s largest landfills &nbsp;and the center of Rio de Janeiro. Around 6 percent of the Brazilian population resides in favelas—informal, makeshift neighborhoods that are often disconnected from urban infrastructure, even as the city center depends on their labor force. To draw attention to living conditions in the favelas, Muniz collaborated with the laborers who make their living recycling materials from the landfill and used those materials to construct an image that echoes Christian iconography of the Virgin Mary, baby Jesus, and Saint John—an iconic representation of innocence and empathy. For Anatsui and Muniz, their process is not only a matter of finding beauty in refuse but also a means of forcing viewers to engage with the materials and subjects that societies push outside their fields of vision.</p><p>Making difficult or misunderstood realities approachable and engaging is a central strategy among the artists on view. In his captivating work <i>The Wait</i> (2009), Chinese artist Ji Yunfei marshals the traditions of calligraphy and scroll painting to draw attention to the plight of the 1.5 million people displaced from the Chinese provinces of Hubei and Sichuan, where they had lived for generations, by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in 1994. The American-Cuban artist duo Allora and Calzadilla adds symbolic weight and critical perspective to the United States military’s presence in Vieques, Puerto Rico, imprinting the land with statements of protest and images of occupation and freedom that they documented in the photographic series <i>Land Mark (Foot Prints)</i> (2001–2).</p><p>Through a radical economy of means, the Cuban American artist Felix Gonzalez-Torres created sublimely beautiful works from everyday materials that speak to the traditions of portraiture, still life, and the complexity of queer identity. <i>Untitled (Last Light)</i> (1993) consists of a string of twenty-four lightbulbs attached to the wall with a single nail. Deceptively simple, it is one of several elegiac portraits the artist made to grieve the loss of his partner, Ross Laycock, who died from AIDS-related illnesses two years before. The twenty-four lightbulbs memorialize each of the years of Laycock’s life, and their glow creates a sculpture that permeates the space in which viewers stand. Through the first half of the 1990s, AIDS was a little understood and escalating epidemic, in which biases about who could be infected slowed research, stalled government action, and led it to become, &nbsp;by 1995, the leading cause of death for American men age twenty-five to forty-four. While the government held the affected at arm’s length, Gonzalez-Torres created portraits of Laycock that draw viewers closer.</p><p>Gonzalez-Torres, like each of these artists, understood the disarming power of everyday objects to explore difficult and fear-laden subjects. In a similar manner, simple actions that interrupt the quotidian life of the city emerged as a central strategy of Latin American Conceptual art in the 1970s. Walking through the streets of Bogotá, Colombia, in her film <i>Qué es para Usted la Poesía?</i> (1980), the Chilean artist Cecilia Vicuña poses the titular question “What is poetry to you?” to the city’s inhabitants and, in this action, reveals her journey as a migratory portrait of the city’s social strata. Whether given in a salsa club, city square, university, or brothel, her respondents’ wide-ranging answers describe poetry as the transformation of everyday language into a powerful, emotional, and even revolutionary force.</p><p><i>Migration and Material Alchemy</i> is part of a community- wide initiative that explores the theme of migration through myriad lenses. This installation treats migration as an abstract idea of metaphysical as well as physical transformation and posits that presenting subjects in a transient state allows artists to tackle issues of great political sensitivity. Artists thus engage strategies of metaphor and metamorphosis to transcend cultural or political limitations, examples of which can be found in every country. In celebration of the fiftieth year of the Program &nbsp;in Latin American Studies at Princeton University, this selection features artists from Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Peru.</p><p><br>Mitra Abbaspour &nbsp;<br>Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Princeton University Art Museum &nbsp; Spring 2018 Magazine<br>&nbsp;</p>",
