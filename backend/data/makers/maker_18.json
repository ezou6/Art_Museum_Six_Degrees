Adams was among the first photographers to confront the intrusion of settlement and development in the West. Instead of relegating his photography to the sliver of the landscape that was still wilderness, Adams began to photograph the housing subdivi­sions that spread north from Denver along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Although his style is often seen as direct and austere, the sensitive quality of his printing reflects an empathy both for these places and for their fate.",

            "body":"<p>American Landscape Photography Since 1968 The idea of wilderness and the frontier—as a challenge, a resource, and later, an escape—was central to the formation of our national identity. In contrast to a civilized and cultivated Europe, the vast, unsettled land of the American West was this country’s most distinguishing feature. Well past the Second World War, the ideal of a sublime and unpopulated western landscape was offered to an eager public by such photographers as Ansel Adams and Eliot Porter. Through their photographs, often disseminated in close alliance with the conservation movement, “landscape” came to mean “wilderness.” By 1978, photographer Robert Adams was to observe, “More people currently know the appearance of Yosemite Valley and Grand Canyon from looking at photographic books than from looking at the places themselves.” More pointedly, photographer Mark Klett recently wrote of Ansel Adams, “…anyone who has visited the site of one of Adam’s photographs knows that the romance of his landscapes is often best experiences in the photographs themselves. The reality of the place is quite difference. Parking lots of tour buses now intersect the trails to his favorite Yosemite vantage points…Adam’s photographs, while inspirational, may also engender feelings of great loss.” The photographers in this exhibition were among the first to isolate and articulate the fact that not only are there very few large tracts of wilderness left in the United States, but that most Americans live in places that are crowded and over-developed, in cities and suburbs that deny an unobstructed view of the horizon. These artists have sought to define a new style of landscape photography that acknowledges these realities, and together they offer alternatives to the traditional assumption that a completely unadulterated wilderness is the only worthy subject of landscape photography. This shift in emphasis can be seen in <em>Woods, Redding, Connecticut,</em> 1970 by Paul Caponigro. Although Caponigro’s style is firmly rooted in a West Coast aesthetic of large format, black and white photography, this work is an intimate, less dynamic landscape that demands contemplation. The life-size scale of Joann Brenna’s 1992 four-panel photograph, <em>Institute Woods, Princeton, New Jersey,</em> surrounds the viewer. A single, sharply focused branch connecting the panels gives a sense of space and created the feeling of walking through the stand of trees oneself. Neither of these photographs is an especially dramatic landscape: each seeks instead to make us more aware of local scenery frequently ignored simply for lack of looking. Robert Adams and Joe Deal were participants in the 1975 exhibition “New Topographies,” a title that suggests photographs more closely allied with documentation than artistic expression. To the contrary, Adams has emerged as perhaps the most devoted chronicler of the contemporary American West, from his lonesome portraits of tract homes huddles along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains to the 1982 view of the smog-filled basin that is now southern California, creating an empathy between the flat, dry tone of his prints and the hot air and haze they record. The borders of Deal’s print <em>Back yard, Diamond Bar, California,</em> 1980, perfectly encapsulate the entire “landscape” where many suburbanites spend their only time outdoors—within the cinder block confines of their own backyards, a cramped and isolated private haven. In his series <em>Altered Landscapes,</em> 1974-1978, John Pfahl manipulated both nature and the viewer, unashamedly doctoring the landscape to create an environment of optical puns. His later photographs are less obviously constructed, but no less weighted. The <em>Smoke</em> series transforms industrial effluent into luminous, billowing clouds and toxin-laden sunsets. In his portraits of famous waterfalls, Pfahl’s presumed subjects are frequently relegated to the background, dwarfed by the buildings and bridges that now surround them. Emmet Gowin, Robert Hartman, and Patrick Nagatani all document destruction of varying types and degrees. Gowin’s early work creates a personal landscape around a close circle of family members and their rural Virginia home, but his more recent aerial photographs of the aftermath of the Mount St. Helens eruption take an increasingly larger environmental view employing natural disaster as a metaphor for the more senseless destruction of the earth that is within our power to control. Hartman’s aerial view of an industrial site in northern California, like Pfahl’s <em>smoke</em> photographs, transforms chemical spills and waste into painterly abstraction. Nagatani’s photographs address the consequences of the. Production and use of the atomic bomb both from his perspective as a Japanese-American and as a resident of New Mexico, a state steeped in the history of the Manhattan Project and now rather unwilling burial ground for eons of radioactive waste. In the late seventies, Mark Klett was one of the founders of the Rephotographic Survey Project, a group of photographers and historians who sought out locations first documented in nineteenth-century government surveys of the West. Klett and others carefully rephotographed these sites in an effort to learn more about the working method of their predecessors and also as a record of the changes of an intervening century. From this experience, he has brought a sense of historicism to his own photographs of the Southwest. Klett frequently allows his hat or the shadow of his tripod intrude into the frame, literally signaling his presence. Uneven borders from the Polaroid negative material he uses draw attention to the process of photography, and the detailed captions written directly on the surface of the print indicating the time and place of each exposure give the appearance of a survey record, creating a personal history as well as a history of life in the contemporary Southwest. Nicolette Bromberg also has returned to a number of well-known nineteenth-century landmarks, but has approached them with as much a sense of irony as history. <em>Mushroom Rock,</em> photographer by Alexander Gardner in the late nineteenth century, appears again, under additional layers of graffiti, while Nebraska proudly celebrated its ‘quasquicentennial’ by selling off its landmarks foot by foot. The[se] photographs…do not indicate an absence of nature, but rather they recognize that very little has escaped untouched. [Since 1968] photographers…became more comprehensive and inclusive in their depiction of the American land. With varying degrees of acceptance and resignation, and sometimes anger, these artists have confronted the overwhelming imprint we have left and tried to redefine the relationship we have with our immediate surroundings. A dramatic photograph of Yosemite does not raise any questions. For most, its value is implicit. The artists represented here seek to raise an awareness of the consequences of two hundred years of relatively unchecked development and to guide us toward an understanding of the environment that requires more restraint and respect by forcing us to recognize the effects of our actions. Photography’s “new job,” according to Robert Adams, is “…to reconcile us to half wilderness,” to offer us a way to come to terms with both the limits and the beauties of our everyday landscape.</p><p>&nbsp;--Toby A.

            "body":"<p><strong>Robert Adams: From the Missouri West</strong></p><p>&nbsp;In 1975, the photographer Robert Adams (American, born 1937) turned his camera to the open spaces that had met the West's first explorers and settlers, relying upon images from the 1860s and 1870s by artists including William Bell, William Henry Jackson, Timothy H. O'Sullivan, A. J. Russell, and Carlton Watkins as his guide. No longer untouched or heroic, however, the places Adams photographed over the next three years mapped more than a century of impact and abuse that extended to nearly every corner of a land that had once seemed limitless: \"When else has a region of more than a million square miles been so damaged in so short a time? We catch ourselves thinking, in the bitterness that can accompany the unexpected sound of an aluminum can bending underfoot, that it would have been merciful if Columbus had been wrong and the world flat, with an edge from which to fall, rather than a circular cage that returns us to our mistakes. The geography seems hopeless.\"' ...Selections from Adams's publication <em>From the Missouri West</em> (1980) [which are in] the museum's permanent collection... [are] arguably the most pivotal body of his work [and where] we find Adams reaching his maturity as a photographer and a printmaker. These images are not structured as a single narrative journey,but rather as a transit along the periphery of the modern West, skirting the massive suburbs that characterize post-war Colorado, Arizona, and California, as well as any illusion of wilderness. Their locations are hard to pinpoint-barren developments, highways, road cuts, and plains etched by dirt bikes-culminating against the Pacific in the clear-cut forests of the Oregon coast. Even more resigned, more elegiac, are photographs made in San Bernardino County, just east of Los Angeles. The air is heavy with smog; a single tree stands vigil over a newly completed freeway: they are scenes laden with disappointment. Adams is a moralist, and these are not easy photographs. We are given a landscape that can be spare and depressing, one that does not allow for a dramatic gesture. Yet his prints convey a sense of light and careful observation, reminding us not only of what has been lost, but that discovery is still possible. To understand Adams's work, it is necessary to recognize that how he makes a photograph is as important as what he photographs, and it is in the empathetic quality of his prints that concern and affection are revealed. We are shown that an anonymous hillside, gently descending across the frame, reveals more of the character and beauty of the West than the anomaly of a Yellowstone or Yosemite. <em>Cottonwood along the Colorado River, Garfield County, Colorado</em> (1978) is among the most elegant images ever made of the American landscape. Discovering a grace in the trunk of a tree arcing across the river's bank-a scene that could be found hundreds of times again, almost anywhere-Adams recalls the harmony found inthe earliest depictions of the West, when both the place and photography were still new.&nbsp;</p><p>--Toby Jurovics,&nbsp;</p><p>Associate Curator of Photography</p>",

            "body":"<p>Adams was born in Orange, New Jersey, in 1937. His family settled in Denver, Colorado, in 1952, where he spent the summers working and camping throughout the West with friends and family. After attending college and graduate school in Southern California, Adams returned to Colorado in the early 1960s to teach English. It was also at this time that he purchased his first camera. As his facility with the medium grew, it became the conduit for a continuing exploration and understanding of the landscape. By 1970, Adams had stopped teaching to devote himself fully to photography. His work became known through a number of important exhibitions, including \"Photographs by Robert Adams and Emmet Gowin\" at the Museum of Modern Art in 1971, \"New Topographies: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape,\" organized by the George Eastman House in 1975, and a 1989 retrospective, \"To Make It Home: Photographs of the American West,\" which traveled throughout the United States. Adams has published numerous monographs, including <em>The New West: Landscapes along with the Colorado Front Range; Denver: A Photographic Survey of the Metropolitan Area; From the Missouri West; Perfect Times, Perfect Places;</em> and <em>Listening to the River,</em> as well as two collections of essays on the practice of photography. Throughout the twentieth century, American landscape photographers sought out dramatic scenery that reinforced the myth of a pristine and unpopulated West. Adams was among the first photographers to turn his lens away from the thin sliver of terrain that remained wilderness, often confined within the boundaries of a national park, and toward the everyday landscape. Upon his return from Southern California, Adams had been startled and distressed by the expansion of the suburbs around Denver and north along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The characteristics of the West that he most cherished-- a sense of space, silence, and the possibility of walking undisturbed for hours-- were obscured not only by the weight of an expanding population, but by the dismal quality of the developments huddled along the flank of the mountains. Undertaking a dispiriting task, Adams began to photograph this new landscape. In the essay \"Truth and Landscape,\" he explained: <em>Our discouragement in the presence of beauty results, surely, from the way we have damaged the country, from what appears to be our inability now to stop, and from the fact that few of us can any longer hope to own a piece of undisturbed land. Which is to say that what bothers us about primordial beauty is that it is no longer characteristic. Unspoiled places sadden us because they are, in an important sense, no longer true.'</em> There is a desolation and severity to Adams's photographs of the Front Range. Although every frame carries evidence of human intrusion, his images are notably devoid of people. Our view of the horizon is obstructed, the silhouette of the mountains blocked by row after row of roofs. An undisturbed vista is nowhere to be found. While his photographs may appear removed at first, Adams asks us to look more carefully: <em>Paradoxically, however, we also need to see the whole geography, natural and man-made, to experience a peace; all land, no matter what has happened to it, has over it a grace, an absolute persistent beauty. The subject of these pictures is, in this sense, not the tract homes and freeways but the source of all Form, light. The Front Range is astonishing because it is overspread with light of such richness that banality is impossible.</em> In their ability to unite the physical qualities of the subject with the qualities of the print, Adams's photographs are an expression of the medium at its most effective. There is a remarkable empath y in his prints. In their dry, austere tone we feel the sun burn the back of our necks as it beats against the siding of a house. We shield our eyes from the raking afternoon light. In recognizing the care and sensitivity with which these photographs were made, we are able to love these places as they are. Adams returned to Southern California in 1982 and 1983, when he made the series <em>Los Angeles Spring<em>. Monumental images, the photographs are larger in scale and scope than those of Denver, befitting the city that created the sprawl that has overtaken the contemporary urban West. They are also relentlessly bleak: <em>Southern California was, by the reports of those who lived there at the turn of the century, beautiful; there were live oaks on the hills, orchards across the valleys, and ornamental cypress, palms, and eucalyptus lining the roads. Even now we can almost extrapolate an Eden from what has lasted—from the architecture of old eucalyptus trunks, for example, and from the astringent perfume of the trees’ flowers as it blends with the sweetness of orange blossoms… Whether those trees that stand are reassuring is a question for a lifetime. All that is clear is the perfection of what we were given, the unworthiness of our response, and the certainty, in view of our current deprivation, that we are judged.</em> The heaviness of the air is palpable—the smog that suffocates Southern California seeps from every corner of these prints. Yet they are also charged with pathos. They seem to suggest that a tree can, in its gesture, mourn, that a mountain can struggle to free itself from a shroud of haze. Seen alongside these photographs from <em>Los Angeles Spring, Southwest from the South of Jetty</em> appears transcendent. The geography is stunning—the mouth of the Columbia River is four miles across, and nearly as far west as one can travel in the United States. It is a place that Adams has returned to over many years, and to which he and his wife… relocated. These rpints embody a feeling of abandon in the radiance of the light—light not simply revealing of form but form itself. In the meditative cadence of the surf and its continual renewal, there seems to be an anodyne to the damaged landscape he left behind. These photographs also serve, however, as a reminder that few places have been left untouched: <em>At the end of the Columbia River there is an especially complex weaving of suggestion. This is the farthest point to which Lewis and Clark traveled in their exploration of the American frontier. Today the shore of the estuary is becoming crowded with human activity—there are condominiums, malls, airports, mooring basins—even while the estuary itself remains home to a reduced but still significant population of marine animals. The air is usually clean, but the river carries dioxins from paper mills and radionuclides from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.</em> Situated along a bend in the Columbia River about 370 miles upstream, Hanford is the government facility that refined plutonium for the nuclear weapons arsenal. Invisible in the shimmering surface of the river, the level of radioactive byproducts entering the river from Hanford is over 500 times above EPA standards. Robert Adams's photographs of the West are among the truest and most affectionate images ever made of this country. They are also among the most challenging. We are asked to acknowledge what we have made of the landscape and, more difficultly, to consider what it is we love. Given that the West has been forever altered, how will we choose to treat what we have left? What obligations do we owe a place? In his photograph <em>Berthoud, Colorado<em>, 1976, a lamp casts the shadow of a tree across the side of a frame house; the cover of darkness creates a sense of stillness and security. But, most importantly, this photograph offers us a moment of grace. In the precision of the line drawn by the lowest plank of siding as it rests upon its stone foundation, there is confirmation that small moments of perfection can still be found, and that in these we can take comfort and build hope.&nbsp;</p><p>--Toby Jurovics Assistant Curator of Photography</p>",

            "body":"<p>GEO 102/ 2017 Much of climate change is invisible to us. The “smoke” you see coming out of smokestacks is not carbon dioxide, which is transparent in visible light, but a combination of water droplets and soot. The trade-offs of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources are generally not discernible. And changes, particularly natural changes, occur so slowly that they can be difficult to observe directly. So, how can the reality of climate change, its impacts, and its solutions be communicated? The photographs in this installation make the invisible visible through a variety of means. - They play with interesting adjacencies, such as a sooty fire next to an oil well in Robert Adams’s <em>Denver<em>, 1974, or a field of wind turbines between sand dunes and a forest fire. - They use unusual vantage points, such as aerial perspectives of landscapes, or the dramatically low viewpoint of smokestacks in Michael Kenna’s <em>The Rouge, Study 59<em>. - They incorporate disconcerting cropping effects, such as the high-contrast presentation of a car factory, or the fragmentary view of coastal houses in Alexander Heilner’s <em>Palm Jumeirah<em>. For those concerned about mitigating and adapting to climate change, we must ask how to make our climate system visible to all. The photographs also challenge us to ask whether Earth’s environment and human civilizations are resilient or fragile—or both. Among the most fragile landscapes are our coastlines, because of sea level rise, and our cryosphere, because the icy parts of the Earth system fluctuate dramatically over decades and millennia. We make ourselves more susceptible to climate change by assuming that these landscapes are stable. What is unique about each landscape shown, in what ways do they change through time, and how do those shifts impact ecosystems and humans? The choice of these photographs is our argument that there is no single answer to these questions.&nbsp;</p><p>-- Catherine Riihimaki, Associate Director, Science Education, Council on Science and Technology&nbsp;</p><p>Veronica White, Curator of Academic Programs&nbsp;</p><p>Students in GEO 102 (Climate: Past, Present, and Future): Amanda Morrison ’19, Lila Currie ’18, Micaela Keller ’20, Grace Searle ’20, and Jenna Shaw ’20</p>",
