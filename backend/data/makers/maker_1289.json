John Bool in collaboration with Alfred Bool and Henry Dixon, who made carbon prints from the Bool's negatives, photographed threatened buildings for the Society for Photographing Relics of Old London. This society was established in 1875 and consisted of architects and antiquarians who wished to preserve a record of historic buildings facing demolition. John Bool, Alfred Bool and Henry Dixon photographed the Oxford Arms Inn near St. Paul's Cathedral in 1875 (ULAN).",
