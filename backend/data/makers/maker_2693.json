    "biography":"Credited by many as the inventor of photography, Talbot began photographic experiments with chloride of silver deposited within paper fibers by the interaction of silver nitrate and sodium chloride in 1834. He coined the term \"photogenic drawings\" and used it first at the public introduction of the process in 1839, though in his private notebooks he used the term \"sciagraphy.\" He created his first successful images in the spring or summer of 1834, and continued making advances in 1835. In 1841 he discovered the calotype, or talbotype (ULAN).",
