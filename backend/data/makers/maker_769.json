            "body":"Franciabigio (1482/83-1525) first studied with Mariotto Albertinelli and later with Piero di Cosimo. He collaborated with Andrea del Sarto and in his various works re­flects the influence of Fra Bartolomeo, Raphael, and Michelangelo.\n\nThe portrait, oil on panel, signed in monogram and dated 1516 on the ledge behind which the figure is placed, was at one time thought to be that of the famous goldsmith and medalist Cara­dosso who worked for several popes, Julius II among them, as well as for Isa­bella d'Este and Federigo Gonzaga. While such an identification cannot be substantiated, it is indeed a portrait of jeweler holding a slate to test gold in his left hand, a ring in his right, with other rings placed on the ledge. The figure is seen against a lovely landscape.\n\nAllen Rosenbaum observes that it is unusual to find an Italian High Renais­sance portrait of such uncompromising realism, undoubtedly reflecting the strong influence of northern painting. It is a portrait of compelling presence and power, a significant addition to the col­lection and especially valuable for teach­ing. ",
