    "biography":"Born into an aristocratic military family and classically educated, La Fresnaye studied at the Acaémie Julian in 1906, the L’Ecole des Beaux-Arts from 1904-08, and the Académie Ranson in 1908, where he became enamored by the painting of Cézanne. Influenced by the work of the Nabis and other early modernists, by 1910 his work was exhibiting a distinctive cubist vocabulary, tempered by a rational figurative manner. By 1913 La Fresnaye had exhibited with the Synthetic Cubists Robert Delaunay, Gleizes, and Metzinger, producing his most well-known composition Conquest of the Air (now at the Museum of Modern Art, New York) that same year. La Fresnaye joined the army in 1914 and was posted to the front, where he was wounded, and received a medical discharge for tuberculosis in 1918. Committed to a sanatorium in 1919, La Fresnaye died from his medical complications in 1925.",
