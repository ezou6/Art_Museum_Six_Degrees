    "biography":"Robert and the partners Eck and Durand were bronze founders who catered to sculptors such as David d'Angers or Barre. Robert worked  with Eck and Durand briefly, which may help to date the bronze; there is also the possibility that the mould of Robert was later acquired by Eck and Durand, as is the case with some of the medallions by David d'Angers. Research on the casting of these Romantic bronze sculptures in ongoing.",
