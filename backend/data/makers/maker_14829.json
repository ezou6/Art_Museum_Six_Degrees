    "biography":"Williams, Jesse Lynch 1892 (1871-1929), began his literary career early in his junior year when he won a short story contest conducted by the Nassau Literary Magazine. He was later an editor of the Lit and, with Booth Tarkington, co-founder of the Triangle Club. While a graduate student (he earned his A.M. in 1895) he wrote Princeton Stories, in which the American undergraduate, who had usually been presented as a football hero, was portrayed at work and at play in his everyday campus setting. Williams was one of the founders of the Alumni Weekly and from 1900 to 1903 its first editor. \r\nIn the quarter-century from 1904 to 1929 Williams wrote six novels and four plays. His comedy, Why Marry? (1917) won the first Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The University made him an honorary Doctor of Letters in 1919. \r\n\r\n",
