            "body":"The museum has acquired an early eighth­ century Tang dynasty (618-907) Buddha head that comes from a cave-temple in the Longmen Mountains in China's Henan province. The head, sculpted in three-quarter relief has long ears with pendulous lobes and bears a solemn expression with down­ cast eyes beneath arching brows that curve out from the bridge of the nose. Evidence of original chisel marks can be seen on the round cheeks, nose, and forehead, and traces of red pigment remain on the lips. In contrast to the dark gray limestone exposed on the back where the head was roughly removed from the wall, the lighter yellow or tan color, of the sculpted surfaces is a result of layers of pigments or patina. The hair is carved in curls and wavy lines across the forehead, and at the top of the head is the <em>usnisa<em>, a high, rounded protuberance that is a distinguishing mark of Buddha imagery. \n\nStrong court patronage for Buddhism during the Northern Wei duynasty (368-534) led to the construction of importantn cave-temples at Yungang in Shanxi province. After the court relocated south to Luoyang, Henan, construction began on the nearby Longmen cave-temples in 494 and was continued for over a thousand years by later dynasties including the Tang. In total, over 1,300 caves, 785 niches, and other structures including more than 100,000 statues and steles were carved into stone cliffs extending across approximately 1,000 meters of the Longmen Mountains. The Longmen shrines, with those at Dunhuang in Gansu province and at Yungang, are some of the most important Buddhist cave-temples in China. While the museum has sculptures from both the Dunhuand and Yungang sites, this head is the first example from Longmen. \n\nThe sculpture, long recognized as being from the Longmen site, has been well published in Chinese and Western scholarship. The statue entered the collection of the noted dealer and collecotr Dikran Kelekian (1868-1951) in New York by 1925. While in Kelekian's collection, it was illustrated in Osvald Siren's <em>Chinese Sculpture from the Fifth to the Fourteenth Century</em> (1925). The head then entered the collection of Sir Rudolf Bing, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera in New York from 1950 to 1972. Bing probably acquired the statue after he moved to the United States in 1949. \n\nThe standard conventions of early sculpture often resulted in stiff formulaic deities in highly stilized, rigid poses. Durign the Tang dynasty, the representation of the human body and its movement began to inform the depiction of Buddhist deities. This transitional moment is captured in the museum's head, which combines meditative serenity and iconic imagery with the graceful elements of flesh and bone that allow viewers to perceive both a human and religious connection.",

            "body":"Tang burial practices mixed those of previous dynasties with different ethnic and local customs. The prevailing belief of life after death encouraged members of the Tang ruling elite to favor extravagant burials. Their tombs are often filled with lavish objects such as figures, gold and silver ware, silk textiles, and jewelry. Among the most important of the tomb figures are pairings of large chimeric beast guardians and warrior guardians. Because of their usual position near tomb gates and their ferocious demeanor, such beast figures are thought to have served as \"tomb guardian creatures\" (zhenmushou), sentinels capable of protecting the earthbound soul of the deceased by quelling demon spirits.\n\nThis pair of beast guardians represents the final stage in the long sculptural evolution. Tomb guardians may have precedents in antlered creatures carved in wood from the Warring States period (ca. 470–221 B.C.). Excavated from tombs in southern China, many of these figures are shown with long dangling tongues and holding or biting snakes. Burial sculptures of this type became rare in the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220), but vivid descriptions of fantastic creatures found in Han literature, pictorial carvings, and Buddhist iconography may have provided rich models for the subsequent evolution of tomb guardian figures. In this later period, beast guardians have human or animal faces, feline-like bodies with pawed feet, and are shown walking on all fours or sitting on their haunches. During the early Northern Dynasties (386–581), single beast guardians were sometimes placed in tombs. By the sixth century, pairings of beast guardians, one with a human face and the other with a lion-animal face, were frequently buried, and often grouped with accompanying pairs of standing warrior figures.\n\nThe standard grouping of pairs of beast and warrior tomb guardians in the Tang dynasty corresponds to mention in burial regulation of the Four Spirits (<em>Sishen<em>). During the Tang, the use of the Four Spirits remained a privilege of the ruling members. In the early Tang, beast guardians may have become associated with pairs of deerlike spirits—auspicious tianlu with one horn and apotropaic bixie with two—which may have resulted in a reassessment of their iconography. Cloven feet replaced paws and horns were added. The final stage in the development of tomb guardian figures occurred from the mid-seventh to mid-eighth centuries, when their function as demon quellers began to be represented visually. Spirit beasts were shown with more human bodies sitting erect while subduing anguished demons underfoot. Surviving examples all date to about the mid-eighth century, and have been recovered primarily from around the Tang capital of Chang'an (present-day Xi'an).",

            "body":"<p><strong>Exhibition</strong><br><strong>Legacy: Selections from the Gillett G. Griffin Collection</strong><br>July 20–October 6, 2019</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>This summer the Art Museum celebrates the life and career of one of its most renowned curators in <i>Legacy: Selections from the Gillett G. Griffin Collection</i>. The exhibition will feature a group of artworks and artifacts from among the thousands donated and bequeathed by Gillett G. Griffin&nbsp;<br>(1928–2016), who served the Museum as Faculty Curator of Pre-Columbian and Native American Art from 1967 until his retirement in 2004. Griffin was not only a respected curator, scholar, and collector but also a beloved teacher and one of the most memorable figures in the history of the University. Among the ﬁfty-ﬁve pieces in the exhibition will be Greek, Roman, Egyptian, ancient Near Eastern, Islamic, African, Chinese, Japanese, and Pre-Columbian antiquities, as well as European and American prints and drawings, and a handful of paintings and drawings that attest to Griffin’s own talents as an artist.</p><p>Gillett Griffin began collecting antiques and New England children’s books when he was a teenager at Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts. During his final year at Yale University he learned typography and then set, printed, hand-stenciled, and colored eighty copies of <i>A Mouse’s Tale</i> (1951), an award-winning children’s book that he himself authored. The following year the young prodigy was hired &nbsp;by Princeton’s Firestone Library as its curator of graphic arts, a post he held for fourteen years. During this time he operated a print shop in the Library and taught non-credit courses on printing, printmaking, paper, calligraphy, and binding. In the sixties Griffin’s career underwent a sea change when he visited Mexico and saw the remains of the ancient civilizations that had produced the few small Pre-Columbian objects he had collected. With characteristic determination he transformed himself into an expert and connoisseur of Pre-Columbian art and left Firestone to become a curator in the Museum and a lecturer in the Department of Art and Archaeology. &nbsp;</p><p>Griffin’s tenure as curator was marked by notable exhibitions. In 1975 it was <i>Jaina Figurines: A Study of Maya Iconography</i>, a small but choice display of terracotta statuettes arising from the senior thesis of his student, Mary Miller, Class of 1975, now the director of the Getty Research Institute. A more ambitious show, in 1978, was <i>Lords of the Underworld: Masterpieces of Classic Maya Ceramics</i>, curated by the distinguished scholar Michael Coe, an exhibition &nbsp;that exerted considerable influence in the fields of Maya epigraphy and iconography. In 1995 Griffin and Museum director Allen Rosenbaum turned their attention to early predecessors of the Maya, mounting the largest and most impressive exhibition of &nbsp;Pre-Columbian art in the Museum’s history, <i>The Olmec World: Ritual and Rulership</i>. Griffin complemented these exhibitions by acquiring for the Museum, through gifts and purchases, hundreds of artifacts from ancient South, Central, and North America. Upon his retirement, the cream of his acquisitions, including many works that he donated himself, were featured in the 2005 exhibition <i>Unexpected Journey: Gillett G. Griffin and the Art of &nbsp;the Ancient Americas at Princeton</i>, which was accompanied by an issue of the <i>Record of the Princeton University Art Museum</i> to which Miller, Coe, and others contributed essays.</p><p>The <i>Legacy </i>exhibition has a different emphasis, celebrating Griffin’s 2016 bequest to the Museum of his personal collection, more than 3,270 objects, of which 2,482 are from the ancient Americas. Among the highlights is a striking terracotta figurine of a woman from Xochipala, Mexico, a precociously naturalistic work made between 400 BC and 200 AD, which is executed in a distinctive style that Griffin was among the first to describe in a groundbreaking exhibition in 1971. Because the exhibition of 2005 focused &nbsp;on the Museum’s existing holdings of Pre-Columbian art, works on view in this area will be drawn exclusively from &nbsp;the 2016 bequest. This allows a spotlight to be cast on the various other areas of the Museum’s collections that have benefited from Griffin’s generosity. Many of these works were acquired by him in the fifties and sixties. The antiquities of Egypt were of particular interest, notably a bold portrait of a bearded man, Roman in date, that was once affixed above the deceased’s mummified head. A trio of horsemen from Cyprus, Mali, and China includes a particularly fine, polychrome rider of the Tang Dynasty. Griffin’s taste for the grotesque is attested by several works, from Mexico to the Mediterranean, among which is a fragmentary Greek clay statuette of the goat-god Pan. Recalling his days as a curator of graphic arts are drawings and prints by such artists as George Romney, Pellegrino Tibaldi, and Winslow Homer.</p><p>If you were to ask anyone who knew Gillett Griffin, they would struggle to adequately describe his unique, inimitable character. One imagines him still, a frightful pun on his lips and a cold Manhattan in his hand: open, unaffected, cheerful, indefatigable, and ultimately, incorrigible. He had a talent for friendship, and his departure has left a vacancy in the hearts of his friends and colleagues. With this exhibition, we salute him once more.</p><p><br>J.
