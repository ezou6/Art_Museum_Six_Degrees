            "body":"In their original contexts, the works’ artistic value often depended as much on the processes through which they became symbolic objects as on their formal qualities. The works make us aware that art in African societies has long been tied to social life and ritual systems. As a result, a sculpture was more likely to be associated with the individual who owned it or the diviner or priest who used it rather than with the artist who produced it.\n\nOne example is a figure identified by his bracelets as a priest or leader, sitting on a cylindrical bench. With fingers held to his lips, he may be whistling to invoke the spirits or concluding a healing session or legal agreement. The wooden sculpture, decorated with mirror, beads, glass, fabric, metal, tooth, and string, is a <em>nkisi</em> (pl. <em>minkisi<em>), which, among people of the Congo Basin of Central Africa, refers both to a spirit and to the charged object or vessel that a spirit inhabits.\n\nAs an object of power and of healing, the <em>nkisi</em> brought together the talent of the artist who sculpted it with the ritual potency of the healer (<em>nganga<em>) who sanctioned the piece and activated its force by attaching medicines to the underlying sculpture. The resinous protrusion that extends from this <em>nkisi<em>’s belly contains these medicinal substances covered by a mirror. Mirrors were used as divination tools by ritual specialists, who would look into their reflective surfaces to determine the sources of problems. The <em>nganga</em> harnessed <em>minkisi</em> in paradoxical ways: to cause affliction but also to heal, to impose taboos but also to mitigate them. In their local contexts, sculptures like this become both objets d’art and symbolic objects, helping to sustain the lives of individuals and their communities.\n\nAnother example...is a headdress from the Yoruba of West Africa, used each spring during the <em>gelede</em> festival held at the beginning of the agricultural season. The Yoruba believe that women possess the ability to effect good or evil. <em>Gelede</em> headdresses are the sculptural expression of this conviction. The power of “mothers”—elderly women, female ancestors, and deities—affects the fertility of fields and families in a positive way. Yet “mothers” can also be destructive, causing barrenness, disease, and other misfortunes. Danced in pairs by men dressed as women, <em>gelede</em> performances endeavor to honor, amuse, and appease all “mothers” in an annual effort to renew the community’s well-being.\n\n<em>Gelede</em> headdresses, worn angled atop the head with a thin cloth covering the dancer’s face, are characterized by their realistic human visages and round pierced eyes. In [2011-62] the women’s lip plug, a mark of prestige and a practice that waned in the early twentieth century, suggests a creation date in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. This artist chose to portray the finely plaited hairstyle of a spiritual person or priestess, evoking the sculptural quality of the hair.",

Over many years in an expert’s service or under a community’s protection, a work of art would evolve through use and wear, ritual sacrifices, or the addition of materials of empowerment.\n\nMasks and headdresses are especially dynamic art forms, their surfaces sometimes repainted by new owners, whether to refresh their appearance for perfor- mances or to draw on the symbolism and power of particular colors. [...] The Kurumba headdress from Burkina Faso representing an antelope displays painted decorative spots and attached red seeds while also revealing subtle wear on the neck and along the snout, where a masquerader would have grasped the piece in order to lift it onto his head and steady it while dancing to honor ancestors and spirits.",

            "body":"Africa has always been a part of global art history; indeed, art-making originated on the continent more than 100,000 years ago. Yet, flipping through most introductory art history textbooks, one could not be blamed for getting the impression that African arts developed in isolation. If connections between the arts of Africa and the rest of the world are made, too often the discussion stagnates at the trope of the so-called discovery of African arts by European modernists like Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani in the early twentieth century. [...]\n\nThree works demonstrate how rulers around the world combined foreign and local symbols to portray their power. The antelope hide cap of an Akan royal gun bearer displays images of both swords and muskets. Representations of European-introduced weapons dominate, but it is the local <em>afena</em> sword that takes pride of place at the cap’s center. Just as Akan rulers embellished their objects of power with foreign symbols, so too did the French. In Jean-Léon Gérôme’s painting of Napoléon Bonaparte in Cairo, the general is shown wearing his trademark black bicorne hat but also holds a curved Mameluke sword—born of the Muslim Seljuq Empire—localizing the exotic to underscore French Christian power. The third object in this conversation illustrates the complexity of Afro-European relationships during the colonial era: a Yoruba ruler’s gold-beaded coronet, likely modeled after Queen Victoria’s coronation crown, may have signified its wearer’s alliance with the British colonizer, yet its symbolism remains rooted in Yoruba visual tradition— the beaded birds allude to the women without whom a leader could not rule. All three objects, while visually distinct, speak to ways the arts represent and augment power.",

            "body":"The Pende word for “mask” is mbuya. Mbuya encompasses not only the mask but the entire masquerade complex, including costume, song, dance, ritual, and other aspects of performance. Masks depicting women may be known as Gambanda or Kambanda (Wife of the Chief) and can also refer to the entire category of female masks, some depicting the “contemporary fashionable woman.” The artist who made this mask paid careful attention to depicting the hairstyle and the woman’s expression. The eyes have heavy lids: they are known as zanze, and their shy, seductive gaze is roughly equivalent to what we call “bedroom eyes.” This mask also presents idealized female facial features: a large, smooth forehead; sharp cheekbones accentuated by curved scarification marks; and a close-lipped mouth. Combined, these facial features and this expression demonstrate the Pende belief that women are more emotionally peaceful than men.\n\n<em><em>Conversation prompts:<em><em>\nDescribe how the artist rendered facial features, paying attention to the use of different materials and colors.\n\nWhat were your immediate impressions of the facial expression on this mask? Have they changed after learning how the Pende interpret them?\n\nHow do cultural conventions about expressions affect our interpretations?",

            "body":"Beautiful beaded works of art...were integral to social and spiritual life in a range of sub-Saharan African cultures, and they document important histories of global trade. African gold, ivory, and, eventually, slaves were traded for European glass beads within an asymmetrical system of power and wealth. As symbols of status, beads were worn for centuries on the bodies of kings, chiefs, priests, and their families, elevating the ordinary while conveying access and prestige. In the kingdoms of western Cameroon, beaded elephant masks were part of elaborate costumes worn by powerful groups whose rituals were often secret. The image of the elephant expressed the authority of the king while the beadwork reinforced this royal association, since beads were reserved for those of noble lineage. In this stunning recent acquisition, white seed beads arranged into repeating triangles create a dazzling positive-negative effect.",

            "body":"The Akan have created terracotta memorial portraits since the seventeenth century; in parts of Ghana, such portraits commemorate important community figures to this day. Historically, the families of those who were to be memorialized handpicked the female artists who created their portraits. Each artist visited her subject multiple times to observe their natural essence. Other accounts say that artists worked from facial impressions left in pillows, or from reflections in water or palm wine.\nThis head memorializes an elite Akan individual, but is not an exact likeness. Instead, it blends idealized royal characteristics (including an elongated head and a “cool” expression with slightly closed eyes, open mouth, and shimmering skin) with individual traits (such as skin color, facial markings, and hairstyle). It is this idea of memory—and conjuring up a person’s essence—that was central to Akan portraits.\n\n<em><em>Conversation prompts:<em><em>\n1.

            "body":"Women in a range of African societies have been recognized within their communities and by scholars as the creators of pottery and baskets, the designers of dyed and woven textiles, and the makers of beaded garments. Yet the profound relationship between women and the artworks of ritual life, including masks and sculpted figures, is often overlooked because woodcarvers and the performers and users of such objects are usually men. This installation highlights the central role women play as creators, subjects, and performers of African visual cultures. the ndoli jowei mask of the Mende, an idealization of female beauty, is a centerpiece of girls' initiation masquerades in the Sande society. The most distinctive feature of the Igbo ikenga, a shrine figure generally associated with men, is an openwork headdress of sacred pythons, the embodiment of the goddess Idemili. Among many South African peoples, the beading of belts, collars, and aprons for both men and women is the exclusive province of women. In the objects on view, we celebrate works produced by female artists and the profound influence of women on ritual and visual culture.",
