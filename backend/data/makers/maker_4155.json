    "biography":"Parmigianino was a precocious artist who lived a short life. He was a success in the shadow of Correggio in Parma, and was then successful also in the Rome of Clement VII. In Rome he executed a few large-scale works and learned printmaking. After the Sack of Rome in 1527, he returned to North Italy, where in his final decade he created some remarkable Mannerist works. His works included small panels and large-scale frescoes, sacred and profane subjects, portraits, and drawings of scenes from everyday life and of erotica. Italian painter. ULAN",
