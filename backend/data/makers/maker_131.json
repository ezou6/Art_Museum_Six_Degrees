Not a good one, but a reason.  The hidden \nwords: will tell or will not tell.\n\nA game, he said. She did not have to turn to look. She \nlooked, and never looked again.\n\nSebastian too agreed.  Will he tell us why he lives on, and \nhow.  He is pierced but gazes on.  Or his rapture is so great \nit overpowers the arrow.  He is elegantly struck, only once.\n\nShe too was struck only once.\n\nI say she turns.  Look how glib she is, and how the air \naround her moves as she does.  She is marble and impervi­ous.  \nShe is precise.  Headless:  her head is missing.\n\nSebastian also turns; he turns toward god.  She also turned \ntoward god when she was struck.\n\nNote the angled hips, the shoulders.  The crook of the necks: \nhis an arrow pointing down, hers an arrow pointing up.\nFigurations of the arrow. Again repeated in her sex. Not so \nmuch in his.\n\nNote that their bellies gently swell. And sweetly. Their skins \nare smooth.  His is warm, yellow; hers is cool and white.\n\nHe has one arrow, piercing him. She has one breast. \n\nHe has two eyes.\n\nHe has the apple of his eye, he has his cheek.\n\nShe has her breast, cool apple.\n\nWhen she was an Amazon, she cast cool arrows- \n\nThese are the passions and the games.\nThese are the games; will they tell us what the passions are.\n\n--Sarah Arvio\n\n",
