    "biography":"Pietro Longhi worked in Venice painting small scenes of peasant life in the city. His work was endearing but often satirical. It was quite popular, although not among English tourists to the city. He had a large output during his career and often painted several versions of his paintings that were later copied by his assistants. \r\n\r\nhttp://wwar.com/masters/l/longhi-pietro.html 3/6/09",
