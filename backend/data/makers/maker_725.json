    "biography":"It is not known whether Alfred and John Bool were related. All that is known is that they photographed together and specialized in picturesque views of the English countryside. Alfred Bool in collaboration with John Bool and Henry Dixon, who made carbon prints from the Bools' negatives, was employed by the Society for Photographing Relics of Old London to photograph threatened buildings. This society was formed in 1875 and consisted of architects and antiquarians who wished to preserve a record of historic buildings facing demolition. Bool photographed the Oxford Arms Inn near St. Paul's Cathedral, London in 1875 along with John Bool and Henry Dixon (ULAN).",
