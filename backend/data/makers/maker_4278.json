    "biography":"Kertész began taking photographs at the age of 12. He concentrated on the qualities of quotidian events in his work. In 1914, he served in the Austro-Hungarian army. From 1922 to 1925, Kertész lived in Paris, selling his photographs for 25 francs in order to make a living. In 1937, he moved to New York City and began his association with \"Harper's Bazaar,\" \"Vogue,\" and \"Colliers\" magazines. His work often concentrates on abstract shapes and shadows created by ordinary objects. After a serious illness, Kertész canceled his contracts with magazines and worked as a freelance photographer until his death (ULAN).",
