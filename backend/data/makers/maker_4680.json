    "biography":"Morris Louis received his degree from the Maryland Institute of Fine and Applied Arts in Baltimore in 1933. He began by painting in a cubist style that he later abandoned in favor of post-painterly abstraction. In 1936, Louis moved to New York and befriended Leonard Bocour, who developed a special acrylic-resin Magna paint for him. Active in New York and Washington D.C., Louis is also considered one of the Washington color painters (ULAN).",

            "body":"<p>The Color Field painter Morris Louis (1912-1962) strove to find new means of applying color to his canvases. Although a painting such as <em>Intrigue</em> initially seems to discourage ecocritical analysis, since it eschews traditional subject matter, it is first and foremost about process and materials. Louis made his “Veil” paintings, of which <em>intrigue</em> is an early example, with Magna acrylic paints, produced for him by the paint manufacturer Leonard Bocour. Louis began experimenting with synthetic paints and diverse application techniques after a visit to Helen Frankenthaler’s studio in 1953 left him impressed by the effects she was able to achieve using unconventional methods. To create <em>Intrigue</em> and his other Veil paintings, Louis thinned Magna color with turpentine and a polybutyl methacrylate called Acryloid F-10, which he purchased directly from the chemical company Rohm &amp; Haas. According to archived receipts, he purchased large quantities of turpentine from Chevy Chase Paint and Hardware Company—at least forty-one gallons in 1955 alone—and ordered Acryloid F-10 from Rohm &amp; Haas in five-gallon increments almost monthly. Based on his receipts for painting supplies in 1958, Louis used approximately nine tubes of paint and four and a half gallons of thinner per painting. The smell of turpentine, which can irritate skin and eyes and damage the lungs, respiratory system, and central nervous system when inhaled, reportedly pervaded the artist’s entire house. Louis died in 1962 at the age of forty-nine from lung cancer, which has been attributed to his prolonged exposure to turpentine fumes.&nbsp;</p><p>Turpentine used by Louis had a devastating effect on environments and people in the American South as well. Prior to World War II, pine-derived resources such as tar, pitch, gum, rosin, and turpentine—also called “naval stores”—were used primarily for shipbuilding and repair. Turpentiners extracted the rosin from remote pine forests from early spring to late fall. Trees were debarked, hacked into, and sometimes coated with acid to stimulate gum flow and finally cut down by loggers after a few years of extraction. In the antebellum period, depletion of northern pine forests moved most naval stores production to the South, where it became part of the plantation economy. By the mid-nineteenth century, naval stores ranked third behind cotton and tobacco as the most important export from the American South. Most turpentine workers, before and after the Civil War, were African American. The industry was so closely associated with black labor and bodies that one turpentine operator even developed a grading system using the names of his African American workers and family members whose skin tones most closely matched the rosins’ coloring.&nbsp;</p><p>--Laura Turner Igoe Collections Assessment Project Manager, Barnes Foundation</p>",

            "body":"<p><strong>Exhibition&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Nature’s Nation</strong><br><strong>American Art and Environment</strong><br>October 13, 2018–January 6, 2019</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a truism of museum practice that cultural artifacts reflect the time and place of their making. So it must follow that contemporary analysis of them—also a creative act of sorts—similarly mirrors the circumstances and preoccupations of our own time. Today, when public awareness of environmental issues has never been greater, the need to imagine more sustainable and ethical habits of human action and thought, including environmentally informed ways of understanding our cultural history, has catalyzed a vital new area of research, the environmental humanities.</p><p>This timely mode of cross-disciplinary inquiry seeks to bridge the gaps between science and the humanities and explore traditionally separate Western, Eastern, and Indigenous ways of perceiving and comprehending the natural world and the human place within it. In the realm of art, curators and art historians have an extraordinary opportunity to address these crucial subjects by illuminating the environmental contexts of aesthetic objects past and present, while fostering a heightened consciousness of ecological realities and concerns. As public institutions, museums can play an especially valuable role in foregrounding these common issues.</p><p><i>Nature’s Nation: American Art and Environment</i> engages this opportunity by telling a new environmental history of North American art, tracing evolving ideas about the environment from colonial encounters between Indigenous beliefs and European natural theology through nineteenth-century notions of progress and Manifest Destiny to the rise of modern ecological ethics and activism. Using the interpretive insights of interdisciplinary scholarship in ecocriticism, <i>Nature’s Nation </i>shows that works of art in all mediums and genres—not just landscape painting—produced by a diverse array of makers, have something to teach us about environmental history and perception by virtue of their subjects and contexts of creation, as well as the materials and techniques employed in their creation.</p><p>This sweeping exhibition traces our changing relationship to the natural world as both reflected and shaped through more than one hundred paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, photographs, videos, and works of decorative art drawn from seventy collections nationwide and from Princeton’s own extensive holdings. The works on view range from colonial furniture to the art of Jeffersonian natural science, Hudson River School landscape painting to Native American basketry, Dust Bowl regionalism to modernist abstraction, postwar environmental activism to contemporary artistic engagement with the Anthropocene, in which environmental change is experienced with particular difference by communities of disparate class and ethnicity.</p><p><i>Nature’s Nation</i> unfolds in three broad chapters—Colonization and Empire, Industrialism and Conservation, and Ecology and Environmentalism—eras marked by growing awareness of human agency as an increasingly powerful environmental factor. The show begins with an introductory gallery, where iconic paintings by Albert Bierstadt and Thomas Moran are displayed alongside contemporary works by Valerie Hegarty and Jaune Quick-to-See Smith that update and revise earlier perceptions of the pristine American environment. An eighteenth􀀁century Chippendale chest of drawers and a 1950s Color Field painting by Morris Louis installed nearby innovatively broach the theme of artistic materials and their environmental implications. Altogether fifteen diverse works set the stage for the following chronological eras, which through related groups of objects in a dozen themed subsections collectively reveal evolving human understandings of nature and our relations within it.</p><p>The ﬁrst era, Colonization and Empire, addresses a period of profound epistemological transformation in visions of natural order, as the classical-Christian tradition of immutable hierarchy gives way to an emerging comprehension of environmental dynamism and complexity. During this period, the discovery of extinction, resource scarcity, pollution, and other revelations of modernity exposed limitations in the older European paradigm, which had represented nature statically and hierarchically as a Great Chain of Being. Major works by Charles Willson Peale and members of his family here acquire new meaning as landmarks of this historic shift, while three subsequent sections on landscape representation explore the use of the picturesque and sublime to variously order and colonize the physical world.</p><p>The second era, Industrialization and Conservation, contains works engaging tensions between progress and preservation, including complex representations of consumption and its effects by Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, George Beaver, and others. The advancing pace, and growing recognition, of the human role in environmental transformation and its pervasive implications were variously examined across the era’s visual culture—from Frederick Olmsted’s “Greensward” plan for Central Park to Sanford Gifford’s <i>Hunter Mountain, Twilight</i>, which both celebrate and scrutinize technological advance.</p><p>Finally, Ecology and Environmentalism considers art of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries that reimagines ecology on a global scale through expansive techniques and media. Works such as Alexandre Hogue’s “Erosions” paintings, Isamu Noguchi’s <i>This Tortured Earth</i>, Eliot Porter’s exhibit-format photography for the Sierra Club, Robert Rauschenberg’s <i>Earth Day</i> lithograph, and Maya Lin’s online project <i>What is Missing?</i> vividly reveal the human capacity to redefine “nature” on a colossal scale while reframing inherited beliefs about progress. During this period, artists inventively embraced new creative challenges posed by ecological issues of unprecedented scope, from the Dust Bowl to world war to global warming and mass extinction. These considerations raise provocative questions: What are the limits and responsibilities of art in an era of ecological crisis? In addition to transforming the planet, is this crisis also forcing a reassessment of received art historical categories and methods by creating new aesthetic opportunities and canons, not to mention new approaches to museum display and interpretation?</p><p>While cultural traditions throughout the world have contributed to human understandings of the environment, the peculiar pace and combination of forces in American history—including the Native-European encounter, slavery, settler colonialism, immigration, industrialization, and mass consumerism, together with catalytic figures in the emergence of modern ecological thought, from George Perkins Marsh to John Muir, Aldo Leopold, and Rachel Carson—make the region an especially appropriate crucible for this ecocritical reexamination of artistic practices and paradigms. At the same time, the exhibition critically engages the idea of America as “nature’s nation,” its title adapted from a seminal 1967 book by the American studies scholar Perry Miller, and challenges the exceptionalism inherent in the term in light of &nbsp;Indigenous, African American, and other cultural perspectives.</p><p><i>Nature’s Nation</i> will provide viewers and readers a compelling opportunity to reimagine the history of American art in environmental terms. Although scholars have made great strides in examining the nation’s artistic production in relation to social and cultural conditions, they have yet to consider issues of ecology or environmental history in a focused and sustained way. By using ecocriticism to rethink landscape painting along with other genres and media, <i>Nature’s Nation</i> aspires to expand the purview of American art history on multiple registers. We hope it may enrich the field, opening it up to new considerations of historical context, materiality, method, and meaning, while enhancing the relevance of American art to a wide audience.</p><p><br>Karl Kusserow&nbsp;<br>John Wilmerding Curator of American Art</p><p>Alan C.
