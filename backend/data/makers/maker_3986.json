    "biography":"Caspar (or Gaspar) Netscher was a Dutch painter of German origin. Little is known of his early years. Recent studies suggest that his father was the German sculptor Johann Netscher (d c. 1641) and his mother the daughter of Vetter, Mayor of Heidelberg. Early in life Caspar came to Arnhem and was apprenticed to still-life and portrait painter, Hendrik Coster (fl. 1638-59).  In 1654 Netscher moved to Deventer where he became a student of Gerard ter Borch. Records suggest that Netscher held a special position in his master's workshop. He moved to The Hague in 1662, where he turned his attention to portrait-painting. He was patronized by William III, and his earnings soon enabled him to purse his own subject preferences that included musical and conversational pieces. Netscher died prematurely in 1684, as he was gaining both fame and wealth. His sons Constantyn (1668-1722), and Theodorus (1661-1732), were also painters.\r\n\r\n",
