    "biography":"Watercolorist, muralist. Born in New York City on September 25, 1887, the son of muralist Elmer Garnsey. The younger Garnsey was a graduate of Harvard University and the Art Students League in New York City followed by study in Paris under Jean-Paul Laurens and Richard Miller. After assisting his father on mural commissions for several years, he acted as president of the Art Students League from 1915-1917 and then served in the Army during the last months of World War I. Upon discharge, he settled in southern California as a resident of Los Angeles and Hermosa Beach. During the 1930's he further studied under Stanley Reckless at Chouinard Art School. By the 1940's he had returned to the east coast where he served as director of the Beaux Arts Institute of Design in New York City. He was active in Scarsdale, NY and Princeton, NJ until his death in the latter in December 1969. \r\nhttp://www.californiaartclub.org/history/cac%20presidents/garnsey.shtml\r\n",
