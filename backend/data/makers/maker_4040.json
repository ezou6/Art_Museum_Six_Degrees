    "biography":"Born in Scotland, William Notman immigrated to Canada in 1856 and soon after his arrival established himself as a photographer in Montréal. Notman's business thrived and he became the most important photographer in Canada. His fame as a portrait photographer drew the Montréal elite, prominent visitors to the city, and ordinary citizens to his studio. Although the major portion of his work was devoted to portraits, he also did landscapes, street scenes, and city views across Canada. Over the years the business expanded to include two studios in both Montréal and Boston with one studio in Toronto, Ottawa, St. John and Halifax as well as several in New England. After William Notman's death in 1891 the family business was passed on to two of his sons, William McFarlane Notman and Charles F. Notman. The Montréal business was sold by Charles F. Notman in 1935 to Associated Screen News. (from: McGill University Archives, Montreal) \r\nhttp://www.photography.ca/photographer/notman_william.html\r\n",
