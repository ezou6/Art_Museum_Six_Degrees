    "biography":"Possibly born in Venice; died in Mechelen or Brussels before July 17, 1516. Barbari was the first Italian Renaissance artist of note to travel to the German and Netherlandish courts. He probably received training with Alvise Vivarini in Venice in the 1490s. His best-known painting is \"Still Life with a Dead Partridge\" of 1504, a a trompe l'oeil probably made for one of the palaces of the Saxon dukes; it is the earliest known independent still life painting of the Renaissance. Barbari signed nearly all his works with a caduceus. Barbari's idiosyncratic facial and figural types influenced contemporary masters such as Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Albrecht Altdorfer, Hans von Kulmbach and Jan Gossart. Italian artist (ULAN).",
