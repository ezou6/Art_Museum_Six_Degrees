    "biography":"Gauss was an influential literary critic and professor of literature. Gauss served as Dean of the College at Princeton University, and after retiring from Princeton was President of Phi Beta Kappa. Though he was not a prolific author or a public figure, Gauss left a mark on literary scholarship: Princeton University's semiannual series of Christian Gauss Seminars in Criticism (founded in 1949 by R.P. Blackmur), and Phi Beta Kappa's annual Christian Gauss Award (est. 1950) for a book of literary criticism are named in his honor.",
