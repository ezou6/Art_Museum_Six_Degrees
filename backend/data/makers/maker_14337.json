    "biography":"George II (George Augustus; 10 November 1683 - 25 October 1760) was King of Great Britain and Ireland, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover) and Archtreasurer and Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire from 11 June 1727 until his death. Born in Germany, He was the last British monarch to have been born outside Great Britain, and was famous for his numerous conflicts with his father and, subsequently, with his son. As king, he exercised little control over policy in his early reign, the government instead being controlled by Great Britain's first de facto Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole. \r\n\r\nThe Province of New Jersey granted a charter -- in the name of King George II -- to the College of New Jersey. Dated October 22, 1746, the charter was unique in the colonies, for it specified that “any Person of any religious Denomination whatsoever” might attend. \r\n",
