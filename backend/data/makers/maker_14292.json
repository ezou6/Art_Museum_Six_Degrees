    "biography":"Vermillion Editions Limited was founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota by Master Printmaker Steven M. Andersen in 1977, following a very successful seven year career launch in New York City.  The studio was established on the sixth floor of an old warehouse building in the nearly vacant north loop area of downtown Minneapolis.  Vermillion soon attracted dozens of both local and nationally recognized artists as well as many other art related businesses.  During the early eighties this area became the newest center for fine art in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.",
