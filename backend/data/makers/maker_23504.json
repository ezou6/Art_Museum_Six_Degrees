    "biography":"The term ‘Company painting’ is used by art historians to denote a special type of painting in a semi-European style that was made by Indian artists in the 18th and 19th centuries for Europeans working for the British, French, Dutch and Danish East India Companies trading in India. \r\n\r\nMost Company paintings were made for the British, who by the late 18th century had assumed wide political and administrative functions in India. The pictures they commissioned reflected the range of their interests, from the costumes and occupations of Indians to architectural drawings of mosques, temples and forts, scenes of spectacular religious festivals and drawings of species of flowers, birds and animals that were new to them.",
