    "biography":"A member of an extensive dynasty of artists and craftsmen, he was among the most original sculptors of the Rococo period in southern Germany. While his decorative stuccowork is an extravagant extension of French Régence models, his figure sculptures, with their elaborate contrapposto and wildly flowing draperies, are an eccentric but expressive amalgam of Italian late Baroque and Swabian late Gothic influences. He worked for much of his life at the monastery of Salem, but his best surviving work can be seen in the interior of the pilgrimage church of Neubirnau, near Konstanz (1748–50).\r\nGDA",
