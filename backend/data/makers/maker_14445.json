He was minister of the Presbyterian Church at Chambersburg, Pa., from 1887 to 1891. He taught logic at Princeton from 1891 to 1912, when he succeeded Woodrow Wilson as president of the university.

His textbooks Inductive Logic (1896) and Deductive Logic (1905) were widely used; his educational ideas are revealed in A Defense of Prejudice (1911, repr. 1970). \r\n\r\nThe Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition | Date: 2008 \r\n\r\n\r\n",
