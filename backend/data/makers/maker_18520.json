    "biography":"Born 10 October 1910, Shulman's images document the built environment of Southern California from the 1930s through the 21st century. He began his career photographing Richard Neutra houses in 1936. From then, he photographed the work of nearly every modernist architect working in the United States, including Rudolph Schindler, John Lautner, Frank Lloyd Wright, Bruce Goff, and Gregory Ain. His published photographs did much to promote the \"international style\" ca. 1936-1970, and illuminated the role of modernist architecture in its environmental context. His archive is held by the J. Paul Getty Trust. He passed away 15 July 2009. ULAN",
