            "description":"Painter Pat Steir discussed her work with art historian Anna Chave. Steir focused primarily on two major paintings that recently entered the Museum’s collections and are featured in the contemporary gallery, alongside works from the exhibition A Material Legacy. Steir has been at the forefront of American painting since the late 1980s when she first experimented with her signature pour painting technique. Now in her fifth decade of artistic practice, her canvases bridge the sensibilities of Eastern philosophy, Abstract Expressionism, and Conceptual art. ",
