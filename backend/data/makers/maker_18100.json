    "biography":"White Mountain Red Ware is a group of related ceramic types produced in the southwestern United States between A.D. 1000 and 1500. Types consist of red-slipped vessels painted with black or black and white designs. Although the pottery is found throughout larger portions of Arizona and New Mexico the locus of production appears to have been eastern central Arizona and west-central New Mexico. Culturally this area was shared by the Mogollon and Ancestral Puebloans. (Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nBibliography on chronology: Carlson, R. L., 1970.
