    "biography":"Born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, Joseph Badger began his career as a house painter-glazier and expanded his business to include portraiture. His work was centered in the Boston area and the surrounding environs. Referred to as a folk-painter because of his more awkward and less polished style, his work was also influenced by the more accomplished artists, John Smibert and John Singleton Copley.  Badger's subjects were of the preeminent men of his day: clergymen, merchants, and public officials. \r\n\r\n",
