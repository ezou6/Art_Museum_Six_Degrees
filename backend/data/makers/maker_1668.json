    "biography":"James Ward was a prolific engraver, known as the most important animal painter of his generation in England. His work is characterized by subjects that are very animated, typically including horses, dogs or wild animals in agitated emotional states, the sense of movement being reinforced by vigorous brushwork and strong colors. His compositions are set in sweeping landscapes and dramatic skies, in the spirit of contemporary Romanticism. Ward also produced portraits, landscapes and genre and history paintings. [ULAN]",
