    "biography":"Miró attended the art school of Francisco Galí for 3 years from 1911, then attended the academy Círculo Artístico de Sant Lluc, until 1918, where he met the potter Josep Llorens Artigas. In 1917, he met Francis Picabia. In 1919, Miró went to Paris, where he settled more permanently from 1920. In Paris, he participated in the Dada movement, renewed his acquaintance with Picasso, who introduced him to Pierre Reverdy, Max Jacob, and Tristan Tzara. In 1924, Miró met André Breton, Louis Aragon, and Paul Éluard, and joined the Surrealist group, whose manifesto he signed. His mature works adhered to a vocabulary of simple shapes and symbols, often described as childlike. Comment on works: abstract",
