            "body":"Because of Dine's use in his paintings of commonplace and commercial ob­jects and images, his work has often been, too hastily, described as pop art. Dine himself feels that, \"Pop is con­cerned with exteriors, I'm concerned with interiors. When I use objects, I see them as a vocabulary of feelings.\" On occasion his vocabulary has included his suit, his shoes, plumbing fixtures, and a whole lawnmower.\n\nTools have fascinated Dine since his childhood,  when he puttered around his grandfather's workshop; and the color range he prefers reflects his early affection for the commercial paint charts in his father's hardware store.",
