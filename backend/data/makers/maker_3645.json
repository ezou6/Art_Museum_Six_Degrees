            "body":"The Matisse drawing, <em>View of Collioure,</em> dates from 1905, the year that Matisse and his wife spent in the port town of Collioure on the French Cote d'Azure. That summer, in a series of vibrant paintings and watercolors , Matisse experimented with a modified pointillist technique, where he combined  short, bold brushstrokes with broad areas of pure color in a revolutionary manner that was later to be referred to as Fauvism. <em>View of Collioure</em> was very likely included in the first Matisse exhibition in the United States, organized by Alfred Stieglitz in 1907.\n",
