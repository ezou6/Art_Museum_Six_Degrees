    "biography":"American silversmiths, active in New York. The company was founded by the silversmith Isaac Marquand in 1810, and traded as Marquand & Co. In 1839 the company was bought by Henry Ball, Erasus Tompkins and William Black, and was known as Ball, Tompkins & Black until 1851, when it became Ball, Black & Company. \r\n\r\nIn 1876 new partners entered the company, which became Black, Starr & Frost, the name under which it now trades; from 1940 to 1962 there was a partnership between Black, Starr & Frost and the Gorham Manufacturing Company, and the retailer’s mark changed to Black Starr Frost Gorham Inc. The company has been a retailer rather than a manufacturer for most of its history; some of its finest products were made in the workshop of John Chandler Moore (GDA).",
