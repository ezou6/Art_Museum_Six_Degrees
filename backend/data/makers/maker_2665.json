    "biography":"Szarkowski studied art history at the University of Wisconsin. He was in the US Army 1945-1946, and later worked as staff photographer at the Walker Art Center, then taught art history and photography at the Albright Art School in Buffalo, New York. He succeeded Alfred Steichen as the Director of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City 1962-1991. He curated influential exhibitions of photographs featuring the work of Lee Friedlander, Gary Winogrand, Diane Arbus and William Eggleston. He is credited with elevating photography's status as fine art through these exhibitions, writing, and lectures. In 1974 he authored \"Looking at Photographs.\" After retiring from the Museum of Modern Art he returned to making his own photographs, which focus on the American landscape (ULAN).",
