    "biography":"John Insley Blair (August 22, 1802 - December 2, 1899) was an American entrepreneur, railroad magnate, philanthropist and one of the 19th century's wealthiest men.\r\n\r\nFor Princeton:\r\n\r\nEndowed a geology professorship, first held by Arnold Henry Guyot. The endowed chair is the second oldest at the school; as of the start of the 2000-01 school year there were 172 such endowed chairs.\r\n\r\nServed as trustee from 1866 until his death. In remarks at his installation as trustee, Blair noted that he had received little formal education and had spent most of his life as a businessman learning addition, but that now \"I have come to Princeton to learn subtraction.\"\r\n\r\nProvided funds to build Blair Hall, which was constructed in 1897 by Cope & Stewardson.\r\n\r\n(Wikipedia, 9/24/08)",
