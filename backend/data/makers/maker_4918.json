    "biography":"A master bronze caster, chaser, and gilder, Gouthière was regarded as the greatest mount-maker during the reign of the Louis XVI. The King acquired 20-30 pieces of his work for his private museum. Marie-Antoinette, the Comte d'Artois, the Comtesse Du Barry, the Duc de Duras, the Duchesse de Villeroy, Princess Kinsky, and the Marquis de Marigny all owned or commissioned Gouthière work. He also executed designs for some of the period's most highly regarded sculptors, such as Louis-Simon Boizot. Although a prolific artist, contemporary scholarship has revealed many of the most important works formally attributed to him, were actually executed by Pierre-Philippe Thomire or Francois Rémond.
