    "biography":"Esther Alexander was from a wealthy Massachusetts family who had expatriated to Florence. Her father was a self-taught portraitist. She spent much of her time working for charities and helping the sick. In order to encourage donations to her charities, she began painting portraits of peasants and the needy, eventually gaining the attention of John Ruskin, who began promoting her work in lectures. When Esther's domineering mother died at the age of 101, she took to her bed and did not leave until her death one year later (ULAN).",
