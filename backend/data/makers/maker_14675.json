    "biography":"James Forrestal was Secretary of the Navy from 1944 to 1947 and the first United States Secretary of Defense 1947 to1949.\r\nAfter the war Forrestal became associated with the campaign against communism. \r\nIn 1948 the journalist Drew Pearson revealed in his newspaper column that during the 1930s Forrestal had been guilty of tax evasion and share manipulation. Other journalists made claims that Forrestal had owned shares in large companies in Nazi Germany and had used his influence to stop the bombing of German cities during the Second World War. \r\nHarry S. Truman was unhappy with Forrestal's performance as Secretary of Defense and on 28th March 1949 forced him to resign from office. Soon afterwards, Forrestal, suffering from depression, was admitted to Bethesda Hospital. On 22nd May 1949 James Forrestal committed suicide by throwing himself out of a 16th-floor hospital window\r\n",
