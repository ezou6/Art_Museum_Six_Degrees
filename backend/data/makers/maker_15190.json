With Herbert Hoover, Pate co-founded the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in 1947 and served as its first executive director from 1947 until his death in 1965.\r\n\r\nTalking about the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjöld, its second Secretary-General, said, \"The work of UNICEF is at the heart of the matter - and at the heart of UNICEF is Maurice Pate.\"[1] Hoover called Pate \"the most effective human angel I know\" when introducing Pate at a UNICEF dinner.[2] Pate was recognized worldwide for his efforts on behalf of children and hungry people.
