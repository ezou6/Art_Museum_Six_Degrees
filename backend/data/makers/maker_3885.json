    "biography":"Despite the original name of the firm (in which Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb and Ford Madox Brown were also active), Morris was the dominant figure, as was acknowledged when it was reorganized in 1875, with a fair amount of recrimination and bitterness, as Morris & Co. In the early years of the firm, he continued to work happily with a group, which in theory at least was his ideal. But from now on there was a recurring cycle in his working life: he would start out with a group and a hope of cooperation; when the group failed he would start out again, eventually operating on his own. The persistence of this ideal, of working in a group, is stated eloquently in News from Nowhere (1890), a picture of Utopia, which became his most famous prose work (GDA).",
