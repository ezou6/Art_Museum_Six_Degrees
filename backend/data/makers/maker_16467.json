            "body":"In her series Projects, Lee adapted methods from anthropological fieldwork and performance art to scrutinize the visual cues of social groups—including drag queens, punks, senior citizens, exotic dancers, skateboarders, lesbians, young urban professionals, and Korean schoolgirls. After making herself over, she would seek admission into these social circles and adapt her style and mannerisms. Lee has said that the pictures were taken by her new acquaintances, with the only instruction being to get her within the frame. The resulting photographs are ambiguous documents of encounters between the artist and her collaborators. Responding to the critique that photographers manipulate the representation of others, Lee investigates the complex dynamic between photographer, subject, and viewer.\n\n<em><em>Conversation prompts<em><em>\n\nWhat are the markers of identity in this work?\n\nHow does the artist’s performance and participation in the work inform the viewer’s reading of the group?",
