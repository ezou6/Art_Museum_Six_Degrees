    "biography":"An important Renaissance engraver, Raimondi's first prints stem from ca. 1500-1505 and show both the influence of Bolognese engravers such as Francia and Lorenzo Costa, as well as Dürer. From ca. 1506-ca. 1508, he was in Venice, making a total of 74 prints after woodcuts by Dürer. During this period, he also made engravings after works by Giorgione and Michelangelo. By ca. 1510, Raimondi was in Rome and had befriended Raphael, who included Raimondi's portrait in his Vatican fresco depicting the Expulsion of Heliodorus. From ca. 1510-1520, Raimondi, influenced by Raphael, primarily engraved designs by the latter and his followers. His style matured, and featured more fluidity in depicting subjects in motion. Raimondi also collaborated with Baviera on prints that, evidence suggest, were reproduced many times. According to Vasari, the 1527 Sack of Rome left Raimondi destitute. His engravings cannot be accounted for beyond that date (ULAN).",
