    "biography":"Between 1996 and 1998, Guyton attended Hunter College, New York.  He's been the subject of over a dozen solo exhibitions (Museum Ludwig, Portikus, Kustverein in Hamburg, and Friedrich Petzel Gallery, among others), and the work he produces in collaboration with Kelley Walker, under the moniker Walker/Guyton, has also been shown widely (Portikus, Greene Naftali Gallery, Venice Biennale).  The number of group exhibitions in which Guyton has participated is extraordinary given his relatively young age; they include venues such as MoMA, the Miami Art Museum, the Turin Triennale, the Hammer Museum, White Columns, the Contemporary Art Museum of Lyon, Modern Art Oxford, the Serpentine Gallery, and the Sculpture Center.  Guyton's work can be found in the collections of the AIC, MoMA, SF MoMA, the Pompidou, and the Whitney, among others.",
