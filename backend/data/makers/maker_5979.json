    "biography":"From 1940 to 1941, Frank worked as an apprentice in a Basel photographic studio and later as a photographer for Gloria Films in Zurich. He emigrated to the United States in 1947 and settled in New York City, contributing photographs to various publications. In 1948 he traveled to Peru and Bolivia, and from 1949 to 1951 he worked in England, Wales, United Kingdom and France. In 1955, Frank travelled across the United States taking photographs for his book 'The Americans'. The book caused great criticism for its depictions of American pop culture, which were labeled 'neurotic'. From 1957 to 1969 he worked as a photographer, filmmaker, and independent producer in New York City, eventually moving to Nova Scotia in 1969 with his wife, artist June Leaf (ULAN).",
