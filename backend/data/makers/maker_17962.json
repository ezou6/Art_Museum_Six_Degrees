    "biography":"“The plastic photographic case industry began with Scovill Manufacturing Company of Waterbury, Connecticut, and the daguerreotypist, Samuel Peck. […] One early supplier for cases to the Scovills was Samuel Peck of New Haven, Connecticut, who began his career as a daguerreotype artist in 1844. By 1850 he was manufacturing cases and soon began a co-partnership with the Scovills that was named Peck and Company. In addition to leather and paper cases, peck began creating “fine cases” including those made from papier-maché. Perhaps it was the technique used in making these cases which inspired Peck to his greatest innovation. By May of 1852 Samuel Peck and his brother-in-law, Halvor Halvorson began producing daguerreotype cases molded from plastic.” p. 1421, Encyclopedia of 19th-century Photography.",
