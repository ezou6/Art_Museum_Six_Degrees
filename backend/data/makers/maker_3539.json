    "biography":"Born in Zurich, Schweizer studied in Germany and Italy after emigrating to the United States. Working out of a studio in Philadelphia’s Tioga neighborhood, he became a specialist in monumental works, many of which were commissioned for sites in Pennsylvania. His bronze of General Peter Muhlenberg stands near the west entrance of the Museum of Art. He also created a massive sculpture of revolutionary general Friedrich von Steuben for Valley Forge and six statues of Civil War generals for the memorial Park at Gettysburg.\r\n",
