    "biography":"Frederic Yates (1854-1919) was an English painter.\r\n\r\nHe gave up a business career to study painting in the Paris ateliers of Léon Bonnat, Gustave Boulanger, and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. In 1886, he moved to San Francisco where his family had settled a few years earlier. In San Francisco, he became a popular portraitist and taught at the newly formed Art Students League of San Francisco. On one of his visits to Europe, he made the acquaintance of the Dowager Marchioness of Downshire who became his patron and introduced him to London society. Yates was active in San Francisco until 1900, when he returned to England, where he died in 1919.\r\n\r\nThe Honolulu Academy of Arts and the National Portrait Gallery, London are among the public collections holding work by Frederic Yates.\r\n\r\n\r\n[edit] References\r\nHjalmarson, Birgitta, Artful players, artistic life in early San Francisco, Los Angeles, Balcony Press, 1999. \r\nHughes, Edan Milton, Artists in California, 1786-1940, San Francisco, CA, Hughes Pub.
