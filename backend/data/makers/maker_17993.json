    "biography":"In 1851, Ferrez travelled to France to study with the sculptor Alphée Dubois. In 1859, he returned to Rio de Janeiro and was apprenticed to the lithographer George Leuzinger. He then learned photography from another employee, Franz Keller, and began to produce photographs of the city that were sold to tourists at Leuzinger's shop. Ferrez opened his own studio in Rio de Janeiro in 1865 called \"Marc Ferrez & Cia.\", which specialized in scenic views of Brazil. In 1875, Ferrez joined the Charles Frederick Hartt expedition and produced photographs for the Brazilian Geological Commission who sponsored the project. In 1902, Ferrez was commissioned by the government of Brazil to document the modernization of Rio de Janeiro. He photographed each architectural façade before demolition and every new building that was erected (ULAN).",
