    "biography":"English family of potters, active also in the USA. Ralph and James Clews (both fl 1818–36) owned a Staffordshire pottery at Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent. Their pottery, which was largely made for export to America, is marked clews or clews warranted staffordshire or clews dresden opaque china. In 1834 the factory closed, whereupon James Clews moved to Troy, IN, where he opened a pottery; when this venture failed he returned to England.",
