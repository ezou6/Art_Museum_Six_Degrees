    "biography":"Oliver Ellsworth (April 29, 1745 – November 26, 1807), an American lawyer and politician, was a revolutionary against British rule, a drafter of the United States Constitution, and third Chief Justice of the United States. On June 20, 1787, while at the Federal Convention, Ellsworth moved to strike the May 30, 1787 motion made by Edmund Randolph of Virginia, that asked that the government be called the \"National Government\". Ellsworth moved successfully that the government continue to be called the United States Government, as it had since the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776.\r\n\r\n",
