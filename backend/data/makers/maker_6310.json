            "body":"This interdisciplinary seminar, supported by Andrew W. Mellon Fund for Faculty Innovation, has focused on Leonora Carrington (1917-2011), a British-born writer and painter who lived in France and Mexico, composing in French and Spanish as well as in English and producing visual art of remarkable power and irreducible strangeness. Among the few women associated with the Surrealist movement, Carrington, throughout her long and intensely productive creative life, eschewed labels of identity, geography, and nationality. She repudiated systems of masculine and colonial authority, and she defied categorisation as an artist and writer, combining wide-ranging influences, crossing repeated boundaries, and undergoing profound personal and creative transformation.\n\nOver the course of the semester, students respond to Carrington’s complex oeuvre by writing essays, responses, and imaginative texts inspired by 1) a close reading of Carrington’s fiction and autobiographical writing and 2) studying, first-hand, her lithographs and paintings housed in Princeton Art Museum’s permanent collection. Selected works by Max Ernst, Kati Horna, Remedios Varo, and Manuel Alvarez Bravo—artists both personally and creatively linked to Carrington—were also viewed and considered. We read excerpts from a number of secondary works which influenced Carrington herself, including Herbert Read’s <em>Surrealism<em>, James Stephens’ <em>The Crock of Gold</em> and Robert Grave’s <em>The White Goddess<em>. Each class centered around a discussion of both her visual and literary production in relation to a series of tropes including animal imagery, metamorphosis, the body, the double, and dreams. Students wrote brief stories inspired by key themes and motifs in Carrington’s stories, creating a “Carringtonesque” portfolio by the end of the semester. They also produced, collectively, a series of “exquisite corpses” inspired by Surrealist writing techniques. The final project was to write a brief essay responding to one of the ten artworks by Carrington which grace the Museum’s collection.\n\n--Jhumpa Lahiri\n\nProfessor and Director of the Program in Creative Writing\n\nAssociated Faculty, Department of Comparative Literature\n\nAssociated Facutly, Department of French and Italian",

            "body":"<p>In the 1990s, through the generosity of David L. Meginnity, Class of 1958 (1936–2000), the Princeton University Art Museum gained an exceptional collection of 140 paintings, sculptures, and works on paper by twentieth-century Latin American artists. The Meginnity Collection, focused on figurative prints and drawings from Mexico and Guatemala, contains many superb examples of modern Latin American art in a variety of styles by artists of several nationalities. This installation presents a selection of these works, together with other significant prints, drawings, and photographs acquired by the Museum over the decades, offering an overview of the development of modern art in Latin America through allegorical representations of the human figure, created during a century of enormous—and often violent—artistic, political, and social change following the Mexican Revolution of 1910–20. The century begins with a populist broadside illustrated by José Posada, who borrowed traditional symbols from the Day of the Dead—an ancient celebration of Aztec origin honoring departed ancestors —to satirize corruption in Mexican society under the long dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz. In the decades that followed, aspiring young artists flocked to Paris and New York to absorb European modernism firsthand, then returned to Mexico to combine modernist theories with Latin American themes and subjects. In the 1930s and ’40s many artists from this first generation of Latin American modernists, such as Carlos Mérida, Diego Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, and José Clemente Orozco, engaged in large-scale mural projects devoted to historical and socialist themes, painted for public buildings in Mexico and the United States. In the 1940s, as the unique character of Latin American art gained an international reputation, the Surrealist painters Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varos fled the rise of Fascism in Europe, finding refuge in the relative exoticism of artistic circles in Mexico City. Following the war, a younger generation of artists—including Raphael Coronel and Francisco Toledo, as well as the photographers Graciela Iturbide and Mario Cravo Neto—drew on the complexity of these established themes and influences to establish a uniquely expressive art that combines ancestral origins with psychologically and politically charged complexities to explore the identity of the artist in Latin America today.&nbsp;</p><p>--Calvin Brown [Former] Associate Curator of Prints and Drawings</p>",

            "title":"In the Classroom : Rethinking Assumptions through Museum Teaching",
            "body":"<p>In the Classroom&nbsp;<br>Rethinking Assumptions through Museum Teaching</p><p>Sometimes, or even ideally, a University class visit to the Art Museum is designed not to illustrate course material but rather to upend it, the encounter with works of art productively undoing assumptions and unsettling students’ well-worn ways of engaging in discussion. As Monica Huerta, assistant professor of English, said about teaching with the Museum’s collections as part of her course “About Faces: Case Studies in the History of Reading Faces”:</p><p style=\"margin-left:80px;\">It’s better . . . that they not so easily be able to ‘apply’ what they may have read to what is in front of them, that they have to search a bit for words, for a framework, for even a position from which to speak. Each time, with each work, they have to find them-selves, get reoriented, and then try to think about &nbsp;what they might have read.</p><p>Huerta was one of three Princeton University professors to receive support in 2019–20 from the Andrew W. Mellon Fund for Faculty Innovation to develop inter-disciplinary courses that use the Art Museum’s collections in significant ways.</p><p>“Russia in Color,” a graduate course taught by &nbsp;Katherine Reischl, assistant professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures, investigated the use, evolution, and perception of color in Russian art, media, and theory. Whether encountering the signature red of old Russian icons, the harmonious color combinations of the Russian modernist émigré Wassily Kandinsky, or the mono- chromatic illusionism of the Russian postmodernist &nbsp;Darina Karpov, students discovered the ways that color &nbsp;not only determines how we perceive a work of art but &nbsp;also mediates its history, ideology, and national politics.</p><p>In one particularly dynamic class session, Museum conservator Bart Devolder demonstrated techniques for icon restoration and pigment use by showing a Russian icon that he had recently restored. As Professor Reischl reflected, “We have all felt how the presence of the works in the room changes the dynamics of a seminar, transforming the space into an art history laboratory.”</p><p>Jhumpa Lahiri, professor and director of Princeton’s Program in Creative Writing, taught “Along the Edge: Leonora Carrington,” which was organized around the Museum’s ten paintings and works on paper by the British-born writer and painter Leonora Carrington (1917–2011), who lived and worked in France and Mexico. Carrington’s <i>Crookhey Hall</i> (1987) and <i>Twins </i>(1997) were for students “artworks of exceptional force, addressing ever-timely themes of migration, exile, transgression, hybridity, transformation, and self-fashioning,” noted Lahiri. Inspired by Carrington’s fiction and by close looking in the Museum’s study rooms, the students wrote essays and creative texts, paying attention to the ways in which the artist continually redefined her artistic and cultural identity, rejecting inherited languages and styles and experimenting fluidly with new ones.</p><p>Artworks in the Museum’s collections propelled students in Huerta’s “About Faces” to experiment with new idioms. Through works as diverse as Rembrandt van Rijn’s etching <i>Bust of an Old Bearded Man, Looking Down</i> (1631), Oscar Gustave Rejlander’s albumen print <i>Ginx’s Baby</i> (1871), and John Singer Sargent’s painting <i>Elizabeth Allen Marquand</i> (1887), the students investigated how the visual arts reflect and undo assumptions about race, class, and gender. &nbsp;While grounded in aesthetic, philosophical, and ethical theories about human faces as markers of identity, classroom conversations ranged widely to consider how &nbsp;the students’ own identities are carried or expressed by their faces and how we form attachments to human faces &nbsp;as well as other faces through photographs, paintings, avatars, and even emoji.&nbsp;The final project, a podcast, encouraged students to choose an aspect of society or history in which &nbsp; “faciality” plays a role —whether in record cover art or biometrics.</p><p>That assignment, as well as other opportunities for close engagement with art afforded by the Mellon Fund &nbsp;for Faculty Innovation this fall, challenged rather than confirmed what students thought they knew.&nbsp;As Professor Huerta said about working with the collections, “The works ask my students to slow down, to unthink their most worn paths for thinking, to consider again, begin again, get familiar with their mindspace anew.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Juliana Ochs Dweck&nbsp;<br>Chief Curator</p><p><br>Princeton University Art Museum &nbsp; Winter 2020 Magazine<br>&nbsp;</p>",

            "body":"<p><strong>Exhibition</strong><br><strong>States of Health: Visualizing Illness and Healing</strong><br>November 2, 2019–February 2, 2020</p><p><br>How have artists given the concept of disease, and the more personal experience of illness, concrete form through art? In gazing at representations of the sick, are &nbsp;we empathetic to the pain of others? How can objects speak to inequities in accessing care, and alternatively, how can they give a voice to the sick? <i>States of Health: Visualizing Illness and Healing</i>&nbsp;draws on the Princeton University Art Museum’s collections, as well as the holdings of Firestone Library, &nbsp;to address and frame questions of illness, suffering, care, and healing as expressed in the global visual arts from antiquity to the present.&nbsp;The works are organized into four thematic groupings—“Confronting Contagion,” “States of Mind,” “Worlds of Care,” and “Childbirth”—that highlight objects’ varied functions as document, metaphor, fantasy, protest, invocation, and testimony. Transhistorical juxta-positions provide an opportunity to reﬂect on culturally diverse artistic interpretations of pain and hope and raise interdisciplinary questions about care as a range of practices complicated by power dynamics. &nbsp;</p><p>In “Confronting Contagion,” the two primary areas of focus are the bubonic plague and AIDS, while additional artworks speak to syphilis, cholera, and typhoid, among other diseases. A painting of Saint Sebastian by the Master of the Greenville Tondo shows the role this early Christian saint played as a protector against the plague, also known as the black death. The work is at once abstract with its black background and depiction of an idealized ﬁgure, suggesting the saint’s divine role as an intercessor, and speciﬁc in its detail of one strategically placed arrow by Sebastian’s groin, where the disease’s pustules were known to appear. A colorful 1992 screenprint comes from a graphic memoir created by the artists David Wojnarowicz and James Romberger that illustrates Wojnarowicz’s life, from his years as a homeless teenager to his struggles with AIDS. Although Wojnarowicz died before the artists could complete the book together, Romberger continued the project and published <i>7 Miles a Second</i> in 1996. The scene shown here communicates the ravaging effects of AIDS and a sense of loss as well as an intense affection between the figures.</p><p>“States of Mind” features artists’ reﬂections on their own mental struggles as well as on the experiences of others. Utilizing different stylistic means, the artists reveal the poignant role of art in communicating inner states of turmoil and inviting empathy from a viewer. Leonora Carrington’s color lithograph <i>Crookhey Hall</i>, for example, depicts fleeing figures and an ominous palace in the background, suggesting associations with her book <i>Down Below</i> (1944), a harrowing account of her experiences in an asylum, where she was given convulsive shock therapy.</p><p>“Worlds of Care” juxtaposes objects used for medicinal treatment with works providing spiritual comfort, and places works reflecting self-care in conversation with objects showing caregiving by a healer or doctor. Gordon Parks’s photograph <i>Isabel Beside Sick Father, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</i> is a powerful image that speaks to suffering as well &nbsp;as to healing. In 1961 <i>Life </i>magazine sent Parks to Brazil &nbsp;for a story on poverty in Latin America, specifically in &nbsp;Rio de Janeiro’s notorious favelas, where he spent weeks documenting the lives of the Da Silva family.</p><p>The last section of the exhibition illustrates the hopes &nbsp;and perils associated with pregnancy and childbirth and the many rituals across cultures surrounding the start of a life. According to a 1970s health study, Yorùbá parents in Nigeria experienced one of the world’s highest rates of twin births. Parents who lost one or both of their twins often commissioned <i>Ère Ìbejì</i> sculptures (such as those shown here). Neither portraits of the deceased nor memorials, these miniature images house the immortal souls of children said not to have died but to “have traveled” or &nbsp;“gone to market.” To care for the child’s spirit, the parents or surviving twin would ritually wash, clothe, and feed the sculpture, resulting in a worn surface. &nbsp;</p><p><i>States of Health</i> grew out of several campus conversations as well as class visits to the Museum, including Professor João Biehl’s class Medical Humanities, which focused on the cross-cultural significance of medicine and present-day struggles for well-being, and Professor Elena Fratto’s seminar Literature and Medicine, which took an interdisciplinary approach to reading texts and considering illness, caregiving, and the field of medicine. This fall a rich array of &nbsp;Museum programs explores the ways in which artists have tackled disease, responded to mental illness, and explored the complexities of care.</p><p><br>Veronica White&nbsp;<br>Curator of Academic Programs</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Laura Giles&nbsp;<br>Heather and Paul G.
