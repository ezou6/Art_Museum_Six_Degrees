    "biography":"Recently awarded the Infinity Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Center of Photography, David Goldblatt is among the most celebrated of African photographers. Goldblatt is one of the few South African artists to have exhibited at Documenta in Kassel, Germany. He also holds the distinction of being the first South African to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Since 1963, he has made photographs of South African society, consciously choosing in the decades of apartheid to make images distinct from what he calls “struggle photography.” In an understated fashion, his pictures aim to represent everyday moments of life in a society rife with racial tensions and power imbalances. His earliest publications depicted the mines outside Cape Town, Afrikaners, and the specific whites-only community Boksburg (Kate Bussard, Curator)",
