    "biography":"Doisneau, along with Brassaï, became famous for his images of the Paris streets during the 1940s. Originally trained as a lithographer, he began his career as a professional photographer in 1934. He served in the French army in 1940, but did not entirely give up his career as a photographer, earning a little money producing postcards. In 1949, Doisneau signed a contract for \"Vogue,\" magazine, but never had the same interest in fashion work as he did in street photography. His images are often humorous, but not with out empathy. His work remained contrast in subject and style throughout his career (ULAN).",
