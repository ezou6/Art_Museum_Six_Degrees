    "biography":"From 1846 to 1848, Black learned the daguerreotype process at the studio of John A. Lerow, Boston. In 1850, Black met photographer John Adams Whipple and the two men formed a partnership called Whipple & Black in Boston. The collaboration lasted from 1856 to 1859. In 1860, Black took the first aerial photographs of Boston. In the same year, he also formed a partnership with another photographer named Case, beginning a collaboration that lasted until the 1870s. The two men introduced porcelain photographs during this time. In 1872, Black photographed the Boston fire (ULAN).",
