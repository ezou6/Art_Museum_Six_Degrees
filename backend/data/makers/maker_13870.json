In this Cretan icon the infant Christ, held by his mother, is shown Instruments of the Passion, borne by the angels Michael (with the lance, sponge, and container of vinegar) and Gabriel (with the cross and nails). Christ becomes so agitated that his sandal falls off. The image implies that from his infancy Christ took on the role of Savior.\n",
