    "biography":"Richard Erdman creates abstract sculpture of both intimate and monumental scale in stone and bronze from his studios in Williston, VT and Carrara, Italy. His art is known for its vitality, energy, and seemingly light buoyant motion, as if defying the material from which it is formed. The power and life the artist bestows in his work, both daring and subtle, conveys passion and strength, deeply engaging the viewer. The artist’s extensive body of work can be found in distinguished public and private collections in over 40 countries worldwide.\r\n",
