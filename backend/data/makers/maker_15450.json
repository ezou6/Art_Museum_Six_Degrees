    "biography":"Raised on the West Coast, Kate Graves moved east in 1995 for an apprenticeship at the Johnson Atelier. The two year program turned into a nearly ten year odyssey as she melted and poured tons of metal as foundry teaching staff, later becoming the school's Purchasing Agent. All the while Graves worked solidly on developing her technical skills, creating a body of work that includes the 'Zero Tolerance Area' series of cast bronze replicas of abandoned Trenton houses. Now a resident of Bucks County, Graves continues to make art, and continues to enjoy working with other artists to create objects and environments of resonance and beauty.",
