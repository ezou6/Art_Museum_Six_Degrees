    "biography":"Bourne & Shepherd was formed in Simla, India ca. 1868. Samuel Bourne acted as principal photographer and travelled widely to collect images for the firm, while Charles Shepherd took care of the business. A second branch was operated in Calcutta by Samuel Bourne and his wife Mary Tolley. In 1870, Samuel Bourne returned to England and he was replaced in 1872 by Collin Murray as head photographer. Charles Shepherd also left the firm in 1885. The firm of Bourne & Shepherd still operates under the same name in Calcutta (ULAN).\r\n\r\nSamuel Bourne and William Howard established on of the first photographic studios in Shimla. After the departure of Howard, Bourne partnered with Charles Shepherd and opened a studio in Calcutta (Kolkata). The studio had branches throughout India, as well as London and Paris. The Calcutta location remained in operation until April of 2016. A fire in 1991 destroyed much of the firm's archives. As of June, 2016 the building's current owners plan to demolish it.
