    "biography":"Around 1862, Russell became the first member of the American army officially assigned to photograph the Civil War. Most of Russell's work was done for the Military Railroad photographing devices used to transport troops and the destruction and construction of roads and bridges. Russell left the army in 1865 and began to photograph construction along the lines of the Union Pacific Railroad from 1868 to 1870. He left the Union Pacific Railroad in the early 1870s and returned to New York where he ran a studio (ULAN).",
