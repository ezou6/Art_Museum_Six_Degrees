            "body":"Kretzschmar was apprenticed as a decorative painter in Dresden, and destroyed most of his student work in 1920. Beginning anew, he began to base his paint­ings and prints on scenes from the everyday life of the people of Dresden and his hometown of Gostritz. He treated this subject with sympathy, humor, and rich detail, rather than assuming an overtly critical position like Otto Dix or George Grosz. Kretzschmar met Grosz when they both attended the Akademie der Kunste in Dresden  (Grosz 1909-1911, Kretzschmar  1911-1920) .\n\nIn this image, the butcher points with one hand toward some sausages, and with the other to a sign above the door of the shop, which reads: \"No credit-from expe­rience I know that I might get rid of meat that way, but then the customers too follow.\"\n",
