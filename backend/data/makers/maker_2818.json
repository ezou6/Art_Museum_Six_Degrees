    "biography":"Gaetano Trentanove (February 21, 1858 - March 13, 1937) was an Italian and American sculptor.\r\n\r\nTrentanove was born in Florence, Italy, a goldsmith's son. He studied at Florence and Rome, became a member of the fine arts academies of Florence (Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze) and Parma, and then opened a studio in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as a result of friendships made in Paris[1] Trentanove subsequently acquired American citizenship and although he spent a portion of every year in Florence, where the foundry that cast his models in bronze was located,[2] he passed most of the remainder of his life in Milwaukee. In 1897 Trentanove was created a knight of the Crown of Italy. After retirement, he returned to Italy where he died.\r\n\r\nTrentanove's public monuments are more easily located than his portrait sculptures, figual sculptures and decorative sculpture.
