Christ displays his pierced hands and points to the lance wound in his side as a reminder of his sacrifice for the salvation of humankind. By emphasizing Christ's wounded body, even in its resurrected state, Rosselli indicates that his sacrificial nature is eternal and the ongoing source of salvation.\n",
