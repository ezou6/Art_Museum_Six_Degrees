    "biography":"From Grove Art Online: \"... the Micali Painter ran a workshop, again at Vulci. His work shows signs of early contact with the Pontic painters, but clearly soon developed its own idiom of fantastic themes dominated by sphinxes and sirens. He painted athletes, chariot-racing and, occasionally, mythological subjects including Herakles, Achilles and Troilos, and the Suicide of Ajax. His mature style reveals a more conscious study of contemporary Attic style, with more added white and subsidiary vase-space filled with palmette florals. Among his followers the Painter of Vatican 238 is notable for his hydria depicting the Transformation of the Tyrrhenian Pirates into Dolphins (Toledo, OH, Mus. A., 82.134).\"",
