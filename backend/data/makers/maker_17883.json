            "body":"Both a personal and a collective memory, Brodsky’s photograph shows an archival photograph of his brother, Fernando Brodsky, who was among the many students kidnapped, tortured, and killed during the Dirty War, a military dictatorship in Argentina from 1976 to 1983. The small photograph of Fernando featured in this work was smuggled out of a clandestine detention camp by Victor Basterra, a survivor of the camp, whose hand is shown holding the archival image.\n\n<em><em>Conversation prompts:<em><em>\n1. Do you have any particular associations with the medium of black-and-white photography that you might bring to your reading of this image?\n2. What is the effect of placing a photograph within a photograph?\n3. How can we read this work as social commentary? (How did the work shift in meaning as it moved from archival record to personal memento to work of art)?",
