    "biography":"William Bowen graduated from Denison University in 1955, and Princeton University in 1958, where he earned a PhD. He joined the Princeton faculty in 1958, specializing in labor economics.\r\nIn 1988, he left Princeton and joined The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, where he created a research program to investigate doctoral education, collegiate admissions, independent research libraries, and charitable nonprofits in order to ensure that the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's grants would be well-informed and more effective.\r\nWilliam Bowen has also been partially responsible for JSTOR, the Mellon International Dunhuang Archive, ARTstor, and Ithaka Harbors, Inc..\r\nBowen has authored 19 books, including the Grawemeyer Award-winning The Shape of the River: Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions (co-authored with Derek Bok). His most recent book, Equity and Excellence in American Higher Education (2005), was coauthored with Eugene M. Tobin and Martin A. Kurzweil. Bowen's current research project involves a study of graduation rates at selective public universities in the United States.\r\nRichard H. Brodhead appointed him and Julius Chambers to evaluate the performance of Duke University's administration in handling the 2006 lacrosse team case. Their \"report read almost like a Saturday Night Live parody of the race-obsessed political correctness that is pervasive in higher education...\" (Wikipidia)\r\n",
