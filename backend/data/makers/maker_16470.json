    "biography":"Guy C. Wiggins was born in Brooklyn in 1883, the son of Carleton Wiggins, an American painter in the Barbizon style. Raised in Old Lyme, Connecticut, where his father was part of the art colony there, the younger Wiggins adopted the locally prevailing Impressionist style and stayed with it long after it was considered outmoded, though not without success: in 1920, he became known as the youngest artist with work represented in the Metropolitan Museum's permanent collection.
