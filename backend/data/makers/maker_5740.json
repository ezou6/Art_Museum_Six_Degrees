    "biography":"One of the greatest mezzotint and stipple engravers of his day, Richard Earlom was apprenticed to the London based engraver, G.B. Cipriani and studied at the St Martin's Lane Academy. He won many prizes for his drawings and engravings. In 1774, he began work for John Boydell for whom he created three hundred plates after Claude, published as the Liber Veritas (1777-1819). He also created for Boydell fifty-one plates after Cipriani. Earlom engraved outstanding works both after the designs of his contemporaries and after the old masters. Boydell commissioned his talents for some of the most famous plates in The Houghton Gallery and The Shakespeare Gallery. (National Portrait Gallery)",
