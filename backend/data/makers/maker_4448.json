    "biography":"British painter, draughtsman, sculptor, and etcher, best known for his paintings of animals. Landseer gave his animals anthropomorphic qualities, and usually presented within a naturalistic or dramatic narrative context that revealed their personalities. The noble steed, the faithful hunting dog or the mischievous monkey, were typical actors in his paintings. Landseer's work was enormously popular with the public and commanded high prices among collectors, namely Queen Victoria, who commissioned from him a large numbers of paintings, mostly genre scenes and portraits of the royal family and their pets. However, Landseer's career has a meteoric rise and fall, and he succumbed to mental illness and alcoholism in 1873. British artist. ULAN\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPainter, draughtsman, sculptor and etcher, brother of (3) Charles Landseer. He became the best-known member of the family and was one of the most highly respected and popular British painters of the 19th century. He was first trained by his father, who taught him etching, and he then studied with Benjamin Robert Haydon and at the Royal Academy Schools in London. Precociously gifted, he drew competently from childhood and in 1813 he won the Silver Palette for draughtsmanship at the Society of Arts. In 1815 he exhibited at the Royal Academy for the first time, showing some drawings of a mule and of the heads of dogs. From an early age he was a frequent visitor to the menagerie in Exeter Change in the Strand, London, where he drew lions, monkeys and other animals. Animals remained the main subject of his art, and Haydon encouraged him to study their anatomy through dissection.\r\n\r\nLandseer invested his animals with anthropomorphic qualities. They possess all the strengths and weaknesses of character associated with humanity and are usually presented within a naturalistic dramatic or narrative context that reveals their particular personalities. Such an example is Dignity and Impudence (1839; London, Tate), in which two dogs, a large bloodhound and a small terrier, peer out from the comfort of a kennel. At times strong elements of violence can be discerned, notably in his many hunting scenes, but perhaps most pronounced in the Cat’s Paw (c. 1824; priv. col., see 1982 exh. cat., pp. 56–7), where a monkey uses the paw of a screaming cat to remove chestnuts from a hot stove. He favoured dogs as subjects and depicted them in scenes of touching devotion (e.g. the Old Shepherd’s Chief Mourner, c. 1837; London, V&A) and heroism (e.g. Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller, 1820; Tuscaloosa, AL, Warner Col., Gulf States Paper Corp.). In 1824 he went for the first time with C. R. Leslie to Scotland and was overwhelmed by the inhabitants, nature and the picturesque landscape. He returned each year, and Highland subjects became a significant part of his output, especially pictures of deer and deer hunting, his best-known painting on this theme being the Monarch of the Glen (c. 1851; London, John Dewar & Sons Ltd).\r\n\r\nLandseer’s work was enormously popular with the public and commanded high prices among collectors. Many of his most famous pictures were engraved, usually by his brother Thomas (see (2) above), and these were also received with enthusiasm. Some of his best-known pictures are in public collections. These include the Hunting of Chevy Chase (1825–6; Birmingham, Mus. & A.G.), the Monkey Who Had Seen the World, also known as the Travelled Monkey (c. 1827; London, Guildhall A.G.), a Jack in Office (c. 1833) and a Highland Breakfast (c. 1834; both London, V&A) and a Random Shot (c. 1848; Bury, A.G. & Mus.). Queen Victoria was pre-eminent among his patrons, commissioning a large number of works, including genre paintings and several portraits and conversation pieces of the royal family and their pets (e.g. Windsor Castle in Modern Times, 1841–5; Windsor Castle, Berks, Royal Col.). In the early 1840s he also gave lessons in etching to the Queen and to Prince Albert. The British Royal Collection remains one of the largest repositories of Landseer’s works. In addition to painting, Landseer contributed illustrations to literary works such as the 1828 edition of Samuel Rogers’s poem Italy and the 1854 edition of the Waverley novels by Walter Scott, whom he greatly admired. In 1858 he was commissioned by the government to design four bronze lions (h. 6.7 m) to flank Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square (in situ). His first essays in the medium, they were finally completed in 1866, cast by Carlo Marochetti and put into place in 1867. Although there had been criticism from the press due to his ‘nervous state of health’ at the time he was awarded the commission, when completed, the lions were generally well-received.\r\n\r\nLandseer’s career was meteoric: he became an ARA in 1826 at the youngest permitted age of 24 and was elected a full RA in 1831. After first refusing the honour in 1842, he was knighted by the Queen in 1850. In 1865 he declined the presidency of the Academy due to ill-health. Although he continued to paint, throughout his later years he suffered from mental illness, exacerbated by alcohol abuse. In 1872 he was confined for a time to an asylum and he died the following year. GDA\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nLandseer Family of Artists\r\n\r\nEnglish family of artists. (1) John Landseer had seven surviving children, all of whom painted or drew and were trained by their father in the arts of engraving and etching. They achieved varying degrees of success, notably (4) Edwin Landseer who became one of the most popular painters of the 19th century. John Landseer’s other sons were (2) Thomas Landseer and (3) Charles Landseer. Of his four surviving daughters, Jane Landseer (b 1795) and Anna Maria Landseer (1805–71) were less well-known as painters than Jessica [Jessie] Landseer (1807–80) and Emma Landseer (1809–95). Jessica painted landscapes, portraits and miniatures, and produced etchings after two works by her brother Edwin. Between 1816 and 1866 she exhibited ten pictures at the Royal Academy (e.g. Lassie, 1863) and also showed at the British Institution, Royal Society of British Artists and the Old Water-Colour Society. She was also an engraver and for much of her life she acted as Edwin’s housekeeper. The youngest sister, Emma Landseer, painted under her married name of Emma Mackenzie, exhibited twice at the Royal Academy (e.g. Two Dogs, 1853) and showed eight works at the British Institution, including A Mischievous Dog. John Landseer’s brother Henry Landseer ( fl 1820–26) was a landscape painter who exhibited views of Spain and Portugal at the Royal Academy and the British Institution. Thomas Landseer’s son George Landseer (1829–78) was a portrait and landscape painter. He exhibited biblical and literary subjects at the Royal Academy and the British Institution. He went to northern India to paint portraits and watercolour landscapes and returned to England in 1870. GDA",
