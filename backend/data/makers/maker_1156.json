            "body":"In <em>Ariforum<em>, critic Frances Richard writes, \"Slyly lovely and perversely indirect, Ellen Gallagher's work con­cerns inscription and sign systems and addresses the fragmentations and provocations of racialized identity.\" In Blubber the expansive canvas is destabilized by diffuse and oblique references to minstrel show stereo­ types such as exaggerated eyes, lips, and wigs. These cliched images serve as grammatical punctuation marks for the children's penmanship  paper she employs as a metaphor  for the infantilized language of the minstrel show. By decontextualizing and reproducing these images, Gallagher aims to release them from their encoded  meaning  and initiate  a new visual vocabulary on issues of race. The title of the work  suggests allu­sions to Melville's chapter on \"The Whiteness  of the Whale\" in Moby ­Dick and to Judy Blume's Blubber, a novel of female adolescent torment, as well as to uncontrolled  acts of weeping or \"blubbering.\" [Former] Director Susan M. Taylor describes Gallagher's work as having \"a quiet power that merges traditional abstraction with social commentary.\" \n",
