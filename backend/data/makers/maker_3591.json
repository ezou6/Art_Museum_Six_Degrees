He was a native of Philadelphia and studied at the School of Industrial Art and then at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. He began a career in photography ca. 1912, working for architects, the Ford Motor Company, and other clients. He continued to create highly acclaimed paintings. His later works tended toward less literal renderings. American artist (ULAN).",
