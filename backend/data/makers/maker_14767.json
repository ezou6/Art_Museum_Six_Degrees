    "biography":"William Henry Fitzhugh (9 March 1792-21 May 1830) was a prominent member of the Virginia constitutional convention of 1829-1830 and an officer of the American Colonization Society.\r\n\r\nFitzhugh was born at Chatham, in Stafford County, Virginia. His father, William Fitzhugh, was a member of the Continental Congress. His sister, the noted Episcopalian lay leader Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis, was the mother of Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee.\r\n\r\nFitzhugh owned a townhouse in Alexandria, Virginia, and a plantation called Ravensworth in Fairfax County, Virginia.\r\n\r\nAt the Virginia constitutional convention of 1829-1830, Fitzhugh joined Richard R. Henderson, Charles Fenton Mercer, and James Monroe in representing the district comprising Fairfax County and Loudoun County. He generally supported democratic reforms and voted against final adoption of the new constitution because in his view it did not go far enough in instituting needed reforms.\r\n\r\n",
