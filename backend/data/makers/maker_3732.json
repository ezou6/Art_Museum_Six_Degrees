    "biography":"As a child, Joseph Fortune Meyer (1848-1931) moved from France to the United States, where he was raised in Biloxi, Mississippi.  Like George Ohr and Walter Anderson, his roots in art began on the Gulf Coast.  Meyer served as an apprentice in his father’s pottery studio in Biloxi.  In 1879, Joseph Meyer invited George Ohr to join him as an apprentice at his New Orleans pottery business.  From mentor to George Ohr to master potter, Joseph Meyer threw pottery at Sophie Newcomb College in New Orleans while maintaining a home and making pottery on Deer Island across from the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art.  The exhibition features 34 pieces of Joseph Meyer pottery, c. 1900, as well as one piece of Newcomb Pottery, from the collection of the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art. (Ohr-O'Keefe Museum of Art)",
