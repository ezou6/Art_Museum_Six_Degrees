    "biography":"Ogden M. Pleissner was considered a Realist unimpeded by sentimentality. He began his art training at the Brooklyn Friends School and later attended the Art Students League. Pleissner’s first canvases were of the Grand Tenton Mountains in Wyoming. He became best known for his watercolors of New England scenes. During WWII, Pleissner painted for the Air Force and Life Magazine featured his work based on the Normandy breakthrough. His post-war subjects became concerned with urban life in France, Italy and Spain. Pleissner had precision and clarity in the sense of light that comes through in many of his paintings. This combined with his selection of only pictorial elements that contribute to an overall composition, really characterize his work. Pleissner was also the director and trustee of the Tiffany Foundation. He died in 1983.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.caldwellgallery.com/bios/pleissnerbio.html",
