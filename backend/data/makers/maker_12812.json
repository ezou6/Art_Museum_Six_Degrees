    "biography":"\"Artist Francesc Torres was born in Barcelona but has spent the majority of his career working outside in Paris, Berlin, and New York. In his installation Belchite/South Bronx: A Trans-Cultural and Trans-Historical Landscape he videotaped the abandoned village of Belchite, Spain, which was destroyed in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. He also videotaped the South Bronx, which similarly had suffered from outbursts of violence. The camerawork emphasizes the visual unity of the two locations until they are almost indistinguishable, creating a meditation on history, violence, and modern ruins.\" International Center of Photography",
