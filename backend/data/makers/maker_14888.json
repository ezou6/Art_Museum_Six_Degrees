    "biography":"Sarah Pierpont was born in 1710 in New Haven, Connecticut, to a distinguished family of educated preachers. At age thirteen, she attracted the attention of Jonathan Edwards, who described her extraordinary piety in his essay \"On Sarah Pierrpont.\" They were married four years later, shortly after Jonathan Edwards was ordained a minister in Northampton, Massachusetts. Her husband used her as an example in his sermons, as he often identified spirituality with beauty. During the 1730s Jonathan Edwards was at the center of the Christian revitalizaiton movement in New England known as the Greak Awakening. The excessive fervor of the movement was later rejected and in the late 1740s Jonathan Edwards moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where the family lived there for seven years. In 1758 they moved to Princeton, New Jersey, when Jonathan Edwards was offered the presidency of the College of New Jersey. He died several weeks after taking the post, and seven months later Sarah herself died of rheumatic fever.",
