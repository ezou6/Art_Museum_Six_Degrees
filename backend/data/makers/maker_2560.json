    "biography":"Landscape painter and draftsman is identified as a free master in Antwerp ca.1589. He was later appointed court painter to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague on 15 of April 1594. His contemporaries at court would have included Roelandt Savery, Paulus van Vianen, Hans Verdeman de Vries, and Philippus van den Bossche. Stevens developed landscape as a genre in itself; and often dispensed with the human figure. His paintings are characterized by their use atmospheric effects. Landscape designs he created were reproduced both in pietra dure for decoration of furniture, and as print series. Documentation shows that following the death of Rudolf II in 1612, Stevens may have entered the employ of Prince Charles of Liechtenstein, Stadtholder of Bohemia.
