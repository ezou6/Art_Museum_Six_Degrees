    "biography":"In 1843 David Octavius Hill (1802-1870) joined Robert Adamson (1821-1848) in partnership at Rock House on Calton Hill, Edinburgh, Scotland. Adamson was responsible for taking the photographs and the technical processes and Hill was the artistic director who looked after costuming and arranging the sitters. The partnership lasted until Adamson's death in 1848. Hill ran the studio for a few months afterwards but soon abandoned photography for painting. The studio specialized in producing reference material for painters, landscape views, and most notably portraiture.",
