    "biography":"Jacob Eichholtz was born in Lancaster Pennsylvania to German tavern keepers. He made is living as a coppersmith until a visit in 1809 from painter Thomas Sully inspired him to begin painting. In 1812, he studied briefly under Gilbert Stuart in Boston. Eicholtz moved to Philadelphia in 1822, where during the next ten years he painted portraits of some of the most prominent men and women of his day. Returning to Lancaster in 1833, he continued to paint until his death in 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
