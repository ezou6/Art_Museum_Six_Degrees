    "biography":"Kenneth H. Condit, Dean of Engineering and Applied Science (1940-1954), was a graduate of Stevens Institute in mechanical engineering and of Princeton in civil engineering. He had been an editor of McGraw-Hill engineering journals and, f~or a time, executive assistant to the president of the National Industrial Conference Board. He had also been president of the Princeton Engineering Association. \r\n\r\nCondit's deanship covered the difficult days of World War II and the immediate postwar period. A rapid development of government research plus a greatly expanded program of instruction for civilian and military engineers during the war was followed, in President Dodds's words, ``by a broadening of all areas of teaching and research far beyond dimensions previously envisaged.'' \r\n\r\n",
