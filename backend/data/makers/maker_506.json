    "biography":"American painter, sculptor and conceptual artist whose work deals with diminishing the boundaries between life and art. One of his earliest works dealt with stacks of paper numbered from 1- ca. 1,800,000, and numbers appear on many of his other works as well. In the 1980s, his work dealt with images of corporate greed and the lack of identity in the workplace, such as the anonymous figures featured in the \"Man with a Briefcase\" series. Borofsky's images often appear in a variety of media. One of his best-known images is the \"Hammering Man,\" which appears in both two- and three-dimensional works, including a 3.65 m. high sculpture with a motorized hammering arm.
