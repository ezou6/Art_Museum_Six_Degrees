He was denounced as a \"degenerate artist\" by the Nazis, and four of his paintings were shown in the \"Entartete Kunst\" exhibition engineered by Goebbels in Munich 1937. In 1941 he was officially forbidden to exhibit his work in Germany. After the war, he became a professor at the art academy in Stuttgart (ULAN).",
