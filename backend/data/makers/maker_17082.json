    "biography":"Refers to the period and style surrounding the culture of the island of Bali. The style reflects rich religious and political history based on Hindu Saivism, Buddhism, Islam, ancestor worship, tantric rites, and animism. Beliefs in reincarnation and the thematic idea of humanity's insignificance in the face of nature drive the style. In painting and in drawing, the style features rock wall works, and later under European influences, naturalistic and romantic paintings of stylized animal and human figures set against double or triple horizons made in crayon, oil or gouache media. Sculptural works feature stone constructions of deified representations of Bali rulers, animal and demon figures, and Hindu and Buddhist statues. Bone and tortoiseshell are also used in carvings. Ceramic arts in this style feature utilitarian earthenware and abstract figurines, both human and mythical. In jewelry production, rubies, baroque pearls, ivory, red coral, chasing, and repoussé were used in designing bracelets, necklaces, signet rings, heirloom keris, headdresses, and hair pins. Court jewelry in this style exhibits complex iconography (ULAN).",
