    "biography":"John Randall Bratby (19 July 1928 – 20 July 1992) was an English painter who founded the \"kitchen sink\" style of art that was influential in the late 1950s.\r\n\r\nBorn in Wimbledon, Bratby studied at Kingston College from 1948 to 1950, then at the Royal College of Art from 1951 to 1954. Three years after his graduation he became a tutor at the college. Bratby became famous for his adaptation of the impressionist realism of Walter Sickert and the Camden Town Group towards a more aggressively expressionist style influenced by van Gogh and the Abstract Expressionists.
