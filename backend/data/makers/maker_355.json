    "biography":"Considered to be one of the best red-figure vase painters, the Berlin Painter worked in Athens from about 500 to the 460s BCE. He was a technically masterful and prolific artist with about three hundred of his vases surviving. Almost all his work was in the red-figure technique, but he did try white-ground and black-figure. Although he did not invent the scheme of an isolated figure on each side of the vase surrounded by black glaze, the Berlin Painter popularized and perfected its use. He was not innovative in his subject matter, but he gave his figures a new air of elegance, aloofness, and grandeur. Since the shapes of his vases so precisely fit the proportions of his spotlighted figures, some scholars speculate that he may also have been the potter. As with most ancient artists, the real name of the Berlin Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work. Scholars named him after one of his amphorae in the Antikensammlung in Berlin (ULAN).",

            "description":"This lecture given in conjunction with the opening of the exhibition The Berlin Painter and His World: Athenian Vase-Painting in the Early Fifth Century B.C. on view from March 4 through June 11, 2017. The Berlin Painter and His World is a celebration of ancient Greece and of the ideals of reason, proportion, and human dignity that are its legacy. Focusing on the extraordinary work of a single anonymous master artisan, the exhibition provides a window onto ancient Athenian society at a time of economic growth and cultural flourishing through the art of vase-painting, the largest body of pictorial imagery to have survived from antiquity. Depictions of myths, cult, and daily life on red-figure vases posit questions on love and war, life and death, that still resonate today.",

            "body":"Early in the last century, the Oxford scholar Sir John D. Beazley (1885–1970) began compiling lists of vases that he attributed to individual painters, assigning names to those who left no signature. Basing his approach on the study of Renaissance paintings, Beazley paid close attention to everything from the shape, subject, and decorative scheme to the manner in which small details were habitually, even unconsciously, rendered—ears, ankles, drapery folds. Certainty is impossible, and disagree­ments over attributions are common, but this methodology, when applied rigorously and combined with knowledge\nand experience, makes it possible to identify with confidence works by individual vase-painters and to date their creations more closely than is possible through purely archaeological means.\n\nThe Berlin Painter’s earliest works date from about 505 B.C. and attest his apprenticeship in the principal red­ figure atelier of the late sixth century. For a century, Attic pots were decorated in the black­figure technique, with black figures on a red clay ground. In the red­figure technique, which appeared about 530 b.c., this process is inverted: the background is coated with black slip and the figures are left “reserved” in red. The greater freedom and clarity of red­figure allowed vase-painters to keep pace with larger developments, as when, after about 480 b.c., the robust conventions of Archaic art began to yield to the increased simplicity and naturalism of the Early Classical Style.\n\nThe Berlin Painter’s style is distinguished by a suave elegance and a palpable tension between shape and decoration. His figures, and the ornament accompanying them, are executed with taut, dexterous precision, whether on water jars (hydriai), large wine bowls (kraters), or smaller shapes such as jugs (oinochoai) and oil bottles (lekythoi). The single figures on either side of his amphorae frequently share the same conceptual space. Accompanied by little or no ornament and spotlighted against the black ground, they are framed only by the contours of the vessel itself. Said Beazley of the artist’s early works, “The delicate grace of his figures has nothing weak or cloying; they charm as youth and springtime charm.”\n\nThe vases featured range in size from capacious kraters and stately amphorae\nto slender lekythoi and delicately potted oinochoai. The painted subjects extend from scenes of cult, athletics, and musical performance to numerous encounters between gods and heroes, with Athena, Herakles, and Dionysos being particular favorites. Other works draw on the rich body of Greek myth and epic, with many stories portrayed in novel compositions that demonstrate the Berlin Painter’s remarkable sophistication as an artist.\n\nThe Berlin Painter lived in Athens, and many vases attributed to him have been found there and at other Greek sites. More, however, have been discovered in Italy, to which thousands of Attic vases were exported in the sixth and fifth centuries b.c. In his early period (ca. 505–480 b.c.), the most frequent destination of the Berlin Painter’s work was Etruria, the central Italian homeland of the Etruscans. Some of the finest vases in this exhibition were found in Etruscan tombs at Vulci, Cerveteri, and Chiusi. Although influenced by Greek religion and material culture, the Etruscans were ethnically and linguistically distinct, and their appetite for Attic pottery served their own traditions and practices.\n\nThe people of Athens created the world’s first democracy, where citizens chose their laws and their leaders by the ballot— a system, with all its flaws, that has never been improved upon. It was a time of new hopes but also of great troubles. In 490 b.c., Athens was invaded by the powerful Persian Empire, based in Iran and extending from Egypt to India. Repulsed at the Battle of  Marathon, the Persians returned ten years later to mount a massive invasion of all of Greece. Against heavy odds, the Greeks prevailed, and the leading role played by Athens in this victory imbued the city with new wealth, confidence, and prestige. Depictions of myths, cult, and daily life on red­figure vases provide important insights into Greek culture in this period, but iconography is sterile unless considered alongside the nuances of style, both of the period and of individual artists. Although he would have been considered a humble craftsman within Athenian society, the painstaking identification of the surviving oeuvre of the Berlin Painter now affords him a place among the finest artists of ancient Greece.",

            "body":"<p>Goddess and Polis: The Panathenaic Festival in Ancient Athens</p><p>As I said before, the Athenians are more devout about religion than anyone else.</em> -- Pausanias (I.24.3) With the critical eye common to many travelers in a foreign city, Pausanias made this judgement about the citizens of the polis (city-state) of Athens during a trip there around 150 A.D. It is from his and other historical accounts that we know about the religious rituals of the Greeks as well as their art and architecture, much of which is no longer extant. By the time of Pausanias' visit, the Athenians had been celebrating their most famous festival, the Panathenaia for over seven hundred years. Held in honor of Athena, the patron goddess of the city, it was founded in 566 B.C. and remained a high point of civic and religious life until the fourth century A.D. Study of the Panathenaia is important for the insight it gives us into the social and religious practices of the first democratic society. It also helps us to understand some of the most significant works of art created in ancient Athens, such as the sculpted frieze of the Parthenon and the large painted vases awarded as prizes at the festival. Greek festivals were held on the same date every year and often were celebrated with special splendor every fourth year. The most famous of the festivals were held at Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, lsthmia, and Athens. At these religious celebrations, the worshipers considered it appropriate not only to offer their deities prayer s, votive gifts, and sacrifices of animal flesh, but also to perform musical concerts, theatrical plays, or feats of athletic prowess in the honor of the gods. By holding festivals, Aristotle wrote, the Greeks \"pay due honor to the gods and at the same time provide pleasant relaxations for themselves.\" The Panathenaia was held annually during the summer on the 28th of Hekatombaion (equivalent to late July on our calendar), reputedly the day on which Athena sprang full-grown from the head of her father Zeus. The \"Greater\" Panathenaia, which, like the Olympics, occurred every four years and lasted approximately a week, featured athletic and equestrian contests as well as competitions in music and poetry. It also included special events that were restricted to the members of the ten Athenian tribes, such as the boat race in the city's harbor, military dancing (known as the <em>pyrrhike<em>) and even a contest for something called \"manly excellence.\" The most sacred events of the festival began with a torch race that started in the grove of Plato's Academy outside the city walls and finished at the altar of Athena on the Akropolis. Partly athletic, partly religious, this transfer of fire is still part of the Olympics today. On the following day at sunrise, the official Panathenaic procession commenced at the Dipylon Gate and moved solemnly along the Panathenaic Way to the Akropolis. In the long line of marchers were citizens, other residents of the city, and foreign delegations: knights on horseback , charioteers, musicians, old men bearing branches, youths and maidens with sacrificial equipment, elders, officials, and the priest and priestess of Athena. The festival culminated in the presentation of a newly woven robe, or peplos, which was draped on the sacred olive wood statue of Athena Polias. Now lost, this image may be reflected in the many small terracotta statuettes of a seated goddess that have been found on the Akropolis.&nbsp;</p><p>CONTESTS AT THE PANATHENAIA&nbsp;</p><p><em>\"But as they were running the last part of the race, then Odysseus said a prayer inside his own mind to grey-eyed Athena: “Hear me, goddess; be kind; and come with strength for my footsteps.”</em> – Homer, <em>Iliad</em> (23.768-70) The ancient Greeks were renowned for their practice of staging competitions in which they demonstrated their gymnastic and artistic skills. Some of these contests, particularly the athletic and equestrian events, may have originated in the practice of war and in ritual s honoring the dead. Eventually, however, the games (<em>agones<em>) became cultural and religious celebrations: a dedication of physical energy and display of competitive excellence to honor the gods. By the fifth century B. C., it had become common for professional athletes to travel throughout Greece and compete in a <em>periodos</em> or circuit of games. We know much about such contests from references in Greek literature, but a principal visual source for our knowledge of Greek sport is Athenian pottery, in particular the large vases known as Panathenaic prize amphoras that were commissioned specifically for the festival. Expertly decorated and filled with valuable olive oil, they were given as awards to the victors in most of the athletic and equestrian events. The painted decoration was the same for each vase: on one side, a depiction of the warlike Athena, spear raised and striding forward; on the other, a scene of the contest for which the amphora and its contents were the prize. It is largely from these images that we know about the use of athletic equipment, namely the javelin, discus, and jumping weights, about such details as the dress of judges and trainers, and the various holds of wrestlers. Athletic contests at the Panathenaia consisted of the footrace, pentathlon, wrestling, boxing, and the pankration, a no-holds­ barred type of wrestling with only gouging and biting prohibited. Wrestling, boxing, and the pankration were considered the \"heavy\" events possibly because there were no weight classes and the heftier athletes tended to dominate. Boxing was particularly brutal since no protective equipment was worn except leather thongs to bind the hands, and blows were delivered to the head rather than the body. The equestrian contests were the most dramatic spectacles and were dominated by aristocrats since only the very wealthy could afford to maintain stables and hire jockeys. The four-horse chariot (quadriga) race was probably the most prestigious event, as the largest number of prize amphoras (140) was awarded to the winner. The Greek poet Pindar credits Athena with the invention of the double pipes, so it is appropriate that musical contests were part of her festival. There were four types of competitors: the <em>aulete</em> who played the aulos or double pipes; the <em>aulode<em>, who sang to the accompaniment of the pipes; the kitharist, who played an elaborate form of lyre known as the kithara; and the <em>kitharode<em>, who both played and sang. Music would have been heard as well at some of the athletic events such as pyrrhic dancing, during the Panathenaic procession, at the sacrifice on Athena's altar, and afterwards at the victors' banquets. The contests at the festival also included poetic recitations of the epics of Homer by professional performers known as rhapsodes, whose skill was such that they could reduce their audiences to tears . Like the tragedies and comedies presented at the annual festivals of the god Dionysos, the music and poetry performed at the Panathenaia constituted both a religious act and popular entertainment. Although prize vases were not awarded to the victors in these events, scenes of such competitions were depicted on vases similar in shape to the Panathenaic prize amphora.&nbsp;</p><p>GREEK ART AND THE PANATHENAIA&nbsp;</p><p><em>…she caught up a powerful spear, edged with sharp bronze, heavy huge, thick, wherewith she beats down the battalions of fighting men, against whom she of the mighty father is angered, and descended in a flash of speed from mount Olympus…</em> -- Homer, <em>Odyssey</em> (I.99-102) It is not known whether the city was named for Athena, or if she was named after the polis. Regardless, her image could be seen throughout Athens. Her likeness - and that of her attribute, the owl - decorated the pottery of the Athenians and was stamped on their coins. She was also depicted in m an y guises in the statues housed in her various temples and dedicated by worshipers in the outdoor spaces of the Akropolis. Most often Athena appeared as she is described above-- a warrior armed for battle with helmet, spear, shield, and her aegis, a breastplate fringed with snakes and embellished with the fearsome head of the gorgon, Medusa. She was also worshiped in a more peaceful guise as Athena Ergane, the goddess of craftsmanship, whose patronage of weavers and potters was important for the well-being of the city's economy. Her most famous image in antiquity was the forty-foot colossal statue fashioned of ivory and gold by the famed sculptor Pheidias. As its name Athena Parthenos implies, it stood inside the Parthenon, the temple constructed in 447-432B.C. at the instigation of Perikles. Showing the goddess standing calmly, with her shield and spear at her side and a winged victory in her right hand, the statue symbolized the tremendous civic pride of a city at the very height of its political power. On the Panathenaic peplos, a story-cloth woven by aristocratic Athenian women during the nine months preceding the festival, she was traditionally shown fighting the Olympian gods' mighty enemies, the giants. Although Greek textiles rarely survive, we get a glimpse of the richly decorated garments worn by deities in sculpture and on painted vases, and the Parthenon frieze shows the peplos itself being folded by the priest of Athena. On the Panathenaic prize amphoras, Athena was portrayed as the guardian and protectress of those who worshiped her. The earliest surviving vase of this type was produced at the time of the founding of the festival's athletic contests in 566 B.C. and the latest examples are four centuries later in date. It has been estimated that for each quadrennial festival a minimum of 1400 vases [were] required. The commissions to produce these would have been extremely lucrative for Athenian workshops and were given to some of the finest artists in the city. Panathenaic prize amphoras were painted in a technique known as black-figure, in which the background remains the reddish-orange color of the clay while the ornament and figures are painted with a mixture of water and clay (slip) which fires shiny black in the kiln. This method of vase-painting dominated until 530 B.C., when Athenian potters invented the red-figure technique in which the figures are left in the color of the clay and the background is painted in black slip. However, because of religious conservatism, the festival vases continued to be executed in black-figure. This conservatism is also evident in the figure of Athena on the front of the vases; although she grows taller over time, she retains the static pose and two-dimensional quality of early Greek art. The vase-painters were not so restricted in their depiction of the athletes on the back; their poses and musculature reflect contemporary developments in Greek painting. In addition to the amphora (a two-handled jar for liquids such as oil and wine) Greek potters produced a range of utilitarian shapes. Many, such as drinking cups (kylix or skyphos), the wine jug (oinochoe), and the bowl for mixing water and wine (krater), were used at men 's drinking parties known as symposia. Other narrow-necked shapes like the miniature Panathenaics and the lekythos held perfumed oil, which was used for personal hygiene or for anointing the dead . The lekythos was often decorated in yet another technique known as white-ground in which the surface of the vase is coated with a white slip, on top of which figures are either outlined or drawn in black silhouette. History has already judged the culture of Classical Athens to be a high point of western civilization. To what extent its brilliance can be attributed to the city 's foremost festival , the Panathenaia, is still a matter of conjecture. However, we ca n state that the marble buildings of the Akropolis, the sculptures adorning Athena 's temples, the statues dedicated in her sanctuary, and the vases commissioned for her festival are unsurpassed in all of Greek art. The Panathenaia inspired a level of civic consciousness and pride in polis that in turn generated one of the richest displays of Classical art. Long after Macedonian troops and Roman legions had swept away the political autonomy of the Greek city-states, Athens remained preeminent in the arts. Perikles foresaw the lasting greatness of the city when he spoke these words in his famous funeral oration: <em>Taking everything together then, I declare our city is an education to Greece…mighty indeed are the marks and monuments of our empire which we have left. Future ages will wonder at us, as the present age wonders at us now.</em> -- Thukydides, <em>The Peloponnesian War</em> (II.41)</p>",

            "body":"This fragment from a red-figure lekythos (oil bottle) in the Princeton University Art Museum is attributed to the Berlin Painter and dates to about 490–480 B.C. It represents a woman standing before an altar, on which rests a tall metal incense burner. The woman wears a long linen gown, or chiton, over which is draped a heavier woolen cloak, a himation. Her hair is wrapped in a cloth headdress, a <em>kekryphalos<em>. Her missing right hand holds an oinochoe (wine jug), and in her raised left hand she holds what appears to be a small branch, perhaps for fanning the coals in the incense burner. Over-painting has obscured most traces of the preliminary sketch, but otherwise it is possible to compare elements of the drawing with that on the cup with an Amazon.\n\nOnce again the ground line consists of parallel lines, but now the space between them has been filled with a band of meanders and framed crosses. The woman, the altar, and all the other objects in the scene are surrounded by an eighth-inch band, which is clearly visible in raking light.\n\nRelief lines are used for most internal features—drapery folds, ankles, ear, eye—but they define very few contours in the scene, for example the woman’s chin and the line of her nose, but not her mouth or nostrils. The line of her right leg, visible beneath her garments, is drawn with two relief lines that stop at her knee, which the artist preferred to draw with a diluted slip that fired golden brown.\n\nThe same brown slip is used for her necklace, for the folds of the upper chiton, and for her right breast, visible beneath the gown. The artist used a slightly less diluted slip and a brush to render the wispy locks emerging from beneath the woman’s <em>kekryphalo<em>s.\n\nThese subtle effects of line and color add variety and delicacy to the design, which exhibits several distinctive elements that permit a confident attribution to the Berlin Painter. Among these is the drawing of the eye, whose outline is open at the inner corner, and the pupil to the right of center. The necklace is like many others by the artist, as are the forms of the altar and incense burner. \n\nThe drawing of the ankles is particularly characteristic: two opposing curves, one longer than the other, that never touch.\n\nThe rigid symmetry of the folds of the woman’s himation yields to more widely spaced catenaries that curve toward her right leg but stop short of the edge. The pattern work in the band below is a variation of a design closely associated with the Berlin Painter: individual meanders changing direction on either side of framed crosses, which alternately descend or rise, a subtlety of construction that imparts vitality to the design.\n\nThe result is an elegant, harmonious design, well adapted to the tall, cylindrical shape of a lekythos.",
