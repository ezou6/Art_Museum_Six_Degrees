    "biography":"Italian architect and engineer. He was one of the most gifted and versatile architects of the generation to follow Bramante, and together with Giulio Romano and Sansovino he brought to northern Italy the all’antica High Renaissance style of architecture established in Rome during the early 16th century. He adapted this style to traditions in domestic and ecclesiastical architecture that were prevalent in his native Verona and in Venice. He was much employed as a military architect, and his gateway designs, which gave towns a modern and dignified outward appearance, helped considerably to revitalize the image of the Venetian state after the damaging wars of the League of Cambrai (1508–17). Almost all Sanmicheli’s buildings reveal a new sensitivity to the possibilities of stonework, with a subtlety and refinement of detailing usually contrasted to great effect with bold, massive forms conceived in terms of receding planes, and a wide variety of surface textures together with a judicious but liberal application of sculptural ornament.
